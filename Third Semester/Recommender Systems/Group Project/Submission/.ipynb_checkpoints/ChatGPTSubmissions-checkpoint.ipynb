       "array(['[\\'The groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for January 2015 and the opening ceremony of the World Museum Vienna was announced for the end of 2016. Instead, signs are now warning: Attention, restricted zone! And director Steven Engelsman addresses the audience with a video message on the website. The call for tenders for the construction work had already been prepared, as Minister Josef Ostermayer (SPÖ) has pressed the stop button. \"The minister says: The World Museum Vienna is too big for him. \"\\', \\'The former Museum of Ethnography (MVK) in the right wing of the Neuer Hofburg is not realized in the planned form. In the winter of 2013 it was said that for the repositioning of the ethnographic collections on a total of 4600 square meters state funds of 25 million euros would be available. Suddenly there is only 16. 6 million euros. And the exhibition area has shrunk to 3900 square meters. The saved rooms and millions are to benefit a new historical museum. \\', \\'Museum staff and scientific community are outraged. \"The tailwind has turned into a headwind,\" says director Engelsman. Andre Gingrich, one of the country\\\\\\'s most important ethnologists, speaks of a fuss. \"It gives us the feeling that your concerns are awry. \" The green cultural spokesman Wolfgang Zinggl calls Ostermayer\\\\\\'s approach a \"cultural-political shame\". \\', \\'While the art museums were expanding, the project that dealt with the multicultural present would be eliminated. South Americans, for example, would go on pilgrimage to the World Museum, because this is where the so-called Federkrone Moctezumas, one of the most important testimonies of the pre-Columbian period, is located. The reopened museum should be a kind of house of cultures in which the many migrants can also get to know their origins. \\', \\'Only a handful of museums worldwide have a comparable inventory. While other nations are affording expensive new buildings for the representation of cultural diversity, such as the Musée du quai Branly in Paris, Austria is closing its only window to the world a bit. \\', \\'Those who enter the Heroes\\\\\\' Square have a look at a monster building from the last years of the monarchy. The façade of Istrian Marzana Sandstone, which is rhythmically shaped by heroic figures and columns, rises to the height, the face of cold rule architecture. The New Hofburg was originally planned as the left wing of the so-called Imperial Forum, in which the ruling family (\"Corps de Logis\") and parts of its collections wanted to be accommodated (\"Corps de Musée\"). Today, the National Library and several departments of the Kunsthistorisches Museum are located. \\', \\'After World War I, the Republic took over the former unloved splendor of the Habsburgs, it was a huge, not entirely finished shell for nothing. Neither had a member of the Imperial House lived here, nor was there any need for a gigantic staircase, endless flight of space, and a monumental balcony arched by a triumphal arch. Until the Nazis arrived: Adolf Hitler stood on the balcony on March 15, 1938 and announced before an enthusiastic crowd the connection of Austria to the German Reich. \\', \\'In the summer of 1938, the \"Zentraldepot of confiscated works of art\" moved in. 8000 cultural goods stolen by the Nazis\\', \\'Jewish possessions were stored here. It is as if the shadows of the past lay like a heavy coat over this place. \\', \\'When the Republic began to renovate its maraudous cultural buildings in the 1990s, the Neue Burg remained on the left. Hardly any Viennese knew the collections housed in the central tract. From the main entrance, one can reach the National Library straight away. In the foyer right hand, the entrance to the external sites of art history is located. \\', \"Along the grand staircase, you can go up to the upper floors, where knights\\' armours, old musical instruments and antique sculptures are exhibited. Only experts know that these are partly unique objects. No poster advertises Mozart\\'s piano or the riding harpsichord of Emperor Maximilian. \", \\'For the population of Vienna, the Neue Burg was primarily the place where you go with the children to look at Indians and Eskimos. Since the 1920s, the Museum für Völkerkunde (MVK) had its seat in the right wing, for which the name Corps de Logis has become a naturalist. The fact that hardly anyone gets excited about the reduction of the museum announced by Minister Ostermayer has a simple reason. \\', \\'The younger generation is no longer familiar with the museum. For 15 years it has been closed or only partially opened. At the end of the 1990s the building was completely renovated, but then the money was missing. The renaming of the MVK into the politically correct \"World Museum\" created additional confusion. \\', \\'The black and blue government decided in 2001 to integrate the MVK and the Theatermuseum into the museum group of the Kunsthistorisches; Wilfried Seipel, then KHM General, sold the tax payers as an economic synergy. \"The only point was to plug their own budget hole with the base settlement,\" says Erwin Melchardt, who was a former Krone journalist and an expert in non-European art. \\', \\'The \"enemy takeover\" was planned for four years, but then neither the Ministry nor the KHM administration wanted to know anything about a re-exit. The KHM collected the base payment of 4. 18 million for the MVK and showed no interest in a full-scale operation; a closed museum costs less. The establishment of the showrooms was postponed with the pretext that there were more important ones. \\', \\'For example, Ostermayer\\\\\\'s predecessor Claudia Schmied (SPÖ) made 15 million euros loose for the renovation of the KHM\\\\\\'s Kunstkammer. When the then MVK director Christian F. Feest expressed his \"concern about the future of the house\" in 2010, KHM general Sabine Haag knew no mercy. Feest had to leave, and the MVK employees are no longer accessible to the press. \\', \"Ostermayer\\'s saving measure is the victim of several areas on the south side, towards the Burggarten. Here, a kind of exhibition camp was planned, an insight into the huge depots. Also painted is a branch office of the Zoom Children\\'s Museum, which should convey the value of foreign cultures to young people. \", \\'The fact that the finished package is reopened has to do with another project formulated in the declaration of government, the House of the History of Austria. For decades, the historical museum is to become a reality in the New Castle over the period from the Revolution of 1848 to the present day. \\', \\'The plan provides for 3000 square meters of exhibition space. There is no concept yet, even a collection is missing. Time is pressing, because in 2018 a memorial year is due, with the revolution 1848 and the founding of the republic 1918 as an anniversaries. It is unclear who will take over the organization. \\', \\'Many concepts have already been written, the implementation of which all failed due to the conflict between the parties over the great historical events. For example, in Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss (1892-1934), conservatives see a victim of National Socialism, while social democracy considers him a fascist dictator. \\', \\'The black part of the Reich is represented in the Landesmuseum Niederösterreich in St. Pölten, and the reds unfold their view of things in the Habsburgerburg. In 2018, the head of the state Erwin Pröll (ÖVP) also wants to remember in his own \"house of history\". The progressive historian Oliver Rathkolb heads the Viennese house, his conservative Graz colleague Stefan Karner the house in St. Pölten. There is no cooperation. \"I only know the Viennese project from the newspaper\", Karner wonders. \\', \\'\"There is no need at all for such a museum,\" says historian Eva Blimlinger, rector of the Academy of Fine Arts. \"The beletage in the Hofburg is the best place to convey the recent history of Austria,\" Ostermayer defends his house. The discussed locations are just as numerous as the concepts developed in the past. These included the Palais Epstein, the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum and the Heldenplatz, where a new building was considered. The Neue Burg is cheaper. \\', \\'The exhibition is to be housed in the historically brittle rooms. The \"Leader-Balcony\" belongs to it and the adjacent halls of the collection of old musical instruments, where the predatory art depots were located. The new use interrupts the chronological sequence of the musical epoch, and also the court hunting and set-up chamber of the KHM must be brave. \"If this is decided from a higher point, we have to give up areas,\" says Sabine Haag. \\', \\'The castle is like a vertical labyrinth with broken connecting passages and intertwined spatial sequences, so that a meaningful structure is hardly possible. Wandering the musical instruments into the opening areas of the World Museum? Will the World Museum now have two entrances? Up to now, there are only pencil sketches. \\', \\'When the megalomaniac Neue Burg was still not finished in 1906 after 25 years of planning and construction, there was a flood of polemics in the Vienna press. The \"monstrous building\" was called \"a shame for Vienna\", \"the whole building deserves to be leveled down to the ground\". With the reduction of the world museum and the dilettante start of the house of history, the haunted castle does not become more welcoming. \\', \\'1 House of History: to be built in the first upper floor of the New Castle\\', \\'2 Ephesus Museum: belongs to the KHM and spreads out on the magnificent climbs\\', \\'3 Collection of old musical instruments: must give halls for the House of History\\', \\'4 Hofjagd-und Rüstkammer: the oldest and greatest collection of knights in the world\\', \\'5 World Museum Vienna: The former Museum of Ethnology is getting smaller and cheaper\\', \\'6 National Library: is involved in the planning of the new House of History\\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\\'It is only ten o\\\\\\'clock in the morning, but Maurice Ernst already has an extensive walk through the winter Vienna behind him. He is dressed entirely in black, his hair is brightly blond, his eyes are blue-green. A gold necklace dangles on his wrist, a sports car flinser shines in the left earlobe. The 26-year-old is extremely polite and impressively communicative. He speaks almost without point and comma, his hands speak with him, and he likes to underline statements with the phrase \"point, end, out\". \\', \\'He founded his band Bilderbuch ten years ago as a monastic student in Kremsmünster. Two albums between German-speaking indie pop and ambitious thinker rock brought respectful successes, two singles in 2013 the stylistic reinvention and the breakthrough: \"Plansch\" and \"Maschin\" became hits far beyond the local indie scene, the Bilderbuch opened the German festival stages; the feuilleton reacted euphorically. \\', \\'\"This music is awesome because it\\\\\\'s awesome,\" wrote the Süddeutsche Zeitung, and the same applies to the album \"Schick Schock\", which will be released on February 20th on the band\\\\\\'s own label Maschin Records: Maurice Ernst lets Falco run wild, and picture books give Austrian pop what he missed for so long: a proper portion of sex appeal. \\', \\'Falter: Mr. Ernst, when does your alarm clock ring?\\', \\'Maurice Ernst: Today he was set to ten to eight, but I have already woken up. We have to use the days until the release of the album really. If you have your own label and want to have your fingers in the game as a band everywhere, you have to spend a lot of time and discipline. Because just every detail is important. \\', \"So you\\'re not just an artist, you\\'re also a responsible entrepreneur?\", \\'Ernst: \"Entrepreneur\" isn\\\\\\'t really true, but being an artist is now more than just art. You have to take responsibility to get to where you want to go. \"I\\\\\\'m a musician, and behind me the flood,\" it doesn\\\\\\'t go on anymore. Of course, it\\\\\\'s just about music in phases, but then it\\\\\\'s about artwork, the live implementation, the conception of videos and so on. I\\\\\\'m bad at handing things out because I don\\\\\\'t really trust anyone. \\', \\'So more success means more responsibility and more burden?\\', \\'Ernst: You adapt to a new situation and try to balance quantity and quality without betraying its principles. Suddenly everything goes faster. We come now for example to the Bravo hits sampler. I would have been happy about it for a week because I have always heard it as a child. Now this is only a quick mail, and you are in the head again somewhere else. \\', \\'The alternative band on the Teeniepop CD, how does that fit?\\', \\'Ernst: When we were with \"Maschin\" at \"Welcome to Austria\", Stermann/Grissemann asked us how they should tell us. At this moment it was a very conscious decision to say \"as a pop band\". Also out of defiance, because I was fed up with this eternal \"The Next Indie Band from Austria\"-Blabla. Our music is bigger than this indie thing and this petty Austrian thinking, I thought to myself. \\', \\'The system \"Alternative Pop\" or the system \"Austrian scene\"?\\', \\'Ernst: Both. Genreically, we took more liberties because we realized that we have no limits. Pop brings music to the zeitgeist, he can use clichés of all directions. It\\\\\\'s not only about the sound, but also about the attitude behind it and how to use the music history for his own music. US rapper Kanye West was an important influence. He collaged his hip-hop with elements of European music, and we thought: Hey, we can try that the other way around! That\\\\\\'s exactly what we did with songs like \"Plansch\" and \"Machin\". \\', \\'Did you realize what you had in your hand when those songs were finished?\\', \"Ernst: That might sound bad now, but we thought to ourselves: Fuck, we haven\\'t heard something like that in German in a long time. If anything! How it came to this is hard to explain in detail, you just think: Cool that this happened. Let\\'s just leave things to do!\", \"Ö3 doesn\\'t play your music anyway. \", \\'Ernst: Unlike German stations like Bayern 3, SRF 3 or Eins Live, yes. But then you have to say: I shit on Ö3, because I\\\\\\'m bigger than the system! There are many examples of what\\\\\\'s wrong in Austria in terms of pop. Smiling doesn\\\\\\'t do anything. You have to work on yourself, you have to try something, and you can\\\\\\'t let yourself get irritated. Of course, you need luck and the right moment, but we had that with \"Mashin\". This song made it possible for us to stand up and take a bit of a role model. \\', \\'Is there a tradition in Austrian pop that picture books refer to?\\', \"Ernst: There are parallels between us and Wanda on this point. We\\'re starting to grow up now, it\\'s no longer a child\\'s birthday party. That\\'s why you have the size to deal with Austrian pop history. In the zero years, you had international role models and didn\\'t want to have anything to do with Austrian pop culture. Yes, no quote, no distance! There was something like Ernst Molden or The Nino from Vienna, of course, and that\\'s great, but it\\'s not pop in that sense, it\\'s rather petty art. \", \\'How is it that you and Wanda suddenly think and act differently?\\', \\'Ernst: This has to do with the emancipation of this generation. They say: FM4 good and beautiful, alternative -super, it took it all to be where we are. But now you can start to be naughty. There Peter Cornelius appears, as a Falco quote, and at the next moment you buy the edge from the fendrich and say: \"We are the new Schickeria!\" Point, end, out. It\\\\\\'s about showing: Hey, we are the new heroes!\\', \\'Are you going to find Peter Cornelius too?\\', \\'Ernst: In our song \"Om\" the quotation \"Reif für die Insel\" occurs. But that\\\\\\'s all I mean by \"find\". \\', \\'Unlike Falco, right?\\', \\'Ernst: Falco is actually the only Austrian musician who has had a halo for us as a teenager. After \"Plansch\" and \"Maschin\" Falco covers were produced everywhere in Germany. Logically, our music sounds more like a world, our lyrics also allow something to be said, as with Falco is also a bit hip-hop in it. If this closeness is constantly told you, you can either deny it, or you deal with it. Refusing does not matter, Falco was super-class. Now we do it like the hip-hop in America. \\', \\'What does that mean?\\', \"Ernst: Help yourself where you feel that it\\'s right, move it and get it to a new point. That\\'s our access. Falco is not so far from Kanye West. Falco was actually an overcrowded idiot. For me, this is a very natural development. It\\'s really fun to play with the conditions in Austria right now. \", \\'Speaking of playing: In the video for \"Maschin\" you play with luxury and arrogance. Where did you get the star of the video, the bright yellow sports car?\\', \"Ernst: I went to the bottom of all of Austria\\'s Lamborghini owners. After a long search it turned out that three yellow Lamborghini Diablo in St. Georgen are standing on the Attersee, and one of them we got for the video. It was important that it will be exactly this car, because it meets the design and the spirit of the time that we wanted. The beauty of Lamborghini is that it corresponds to the cliché of the sports car, but with far less prejudice than Ferrari or Porsche. \", \\'Is the Lamborghini Diablo your dream car?\\', \"Ernst: No. I think Italian cars are great, but that\\'s not a car that you can do something with. I must be smart enough to make a bird like that. As a person living in the city, I don\\'t have a car at all, it would only devour money. \", \\'\"Maschin\" became a hit not least through the striking video. A hit, however, that does not run on Ö3. The channel was the most important medium for the domestic pop of the 70s and 80s, today this applies to FM4. Only FM4 is a niche program. \\', \"Ernst: With FM4 you can never start with the criticism, but with what it is worth. FM4 is the reason why there is such a pop-cultivated underground scene at all. Germany, for example, has no comparable channel of this size. This is also noticeable by the music that is created there: Either it tends towards the avant-garde, or it\\'s flat shit. In Austria you can keep your peculiarities, and FM4 plays you nevertheless, if the quality is right. And it\\'s only about them, not about a sound, a certain format. At some point FM4 is also the lid, that\\'s true. \", \\'What is the way out?\\', \\'Ernst: The step abroad. For bands like Wanda and Bilderbuch: If we only had Austria, that would be our gravestone. So I like to be a hero on FM4, and in Germany and Switzerland I swim with you quite normally, because there we run now also once between Lady Gaga and George Michael. \\', \\'What do you think about the much-discussed radio quota for Austrian music?\\', \"Ernst: I find this sad in a music landscape that Germany is looking very jealously at. I want them to make a quota, but of course a quota doesn\\'t say anything about the choice of music. Maybe there should be more editorial decisions again and less format? In Germany everyone is asking what\\'s going on in Austrian pop, while the big decision makers are just shrugging their shoulders here. At the moment, it would be the moment to present Austrian music confidently. Imagine that picture books would be playing on the big stage of the Frequency Festival at 8 pm and that would also get an adequate gig!\", \\'Why is that so unrealistic?\\', \"Ernst: Because the Austrian big festival event is politically a complete crux. Let\\'s consider how many Austrian bands have played on the big two festival stages in the last ten years. \", \\'So you mean the Frequency in St. Pölten and the Burgenland Nova Rock. \\', \"Ernst: Let\\'s just talk about the frequency - the FM4 frequency, in which one would like to think that it has something to do with FM4. The frustration as an Austrian pop musician comes not only from the radio, the small-mindedness of the own scene and the lack of perspective, the frustration comes also from the festivals. There is a mafia behind it, which gets competition by new organizers only this year after many monopoly years. \", \"Who\\'s this Mafia?\", \\'Ernst: Let\\\\\\'s call them by name: Skaler, the company responsible for Nova Rock and Frequency. We always call Skaler in the band \"Mafia\", because it feels a bit like that. They play a pretty hard game with Austrian bands, so we make our own open air in the arena this year. We don\\\\\\'t need Frequency. Either cleverly or not at all. Point, end, out. \\', \"Isn\\'t the uncritical audience part of the problem? Frequency is one of the most frightful festivals in the German-speaking world, but it\\'s still full again and again. \", \"Ernst: The responsibility lies with the people who are at the lever. People tell their opinions anyway. They write into the forum, ask for them, and the artists also become louder and louder. There we are again at the point that you have to be a musician above the system. That\\'s the same with Amadeus. You can scold about this prize, you can refuse it and not go because they have written your name wrong. Bullshit! You have to go, you have to get this trophy, and you have to say: This trophy is worth something because I get it!\", \\'Picture book were nominated in 2014 in four Amadeus categories, but then it became only the \"FM4 Alternative Award\". \\', \\'Ernst: I\\\\\\'m sure I won\\\\\\'t say that they fucked us up right now, but it\\\\\\'s funny when even the people responsible at the award ceremony start to wonder, \"How did that happen?\"\\', \\'Anna F. was also surprised that she was awarded the \"Song of the Year\" and not a picture book for \"Maschin\". \\', \\'Ernst: Kanye West once went on stage when Taylor Swift got a video award. \"That\\\\\\'s a fucking bullshit, because Beyoncé did the coolest video of the last 20 years,\" he said. I could have done that too, but that\\\\\\'s bullshit. You can only laugh about it. The next day, the Kronen Zeitung writes again: \"Dreamer of the day was Christina Stürmer. \" We were the most nominee band in 2014, but media like the Krone didn\\\\\\'t even mention it. Now Wanda with four Amadeus nominations are in the same position. Maybe it changes this year. The point is: we just have to increase the pressure and make it clear that we can\\\\\\'t do it without us anymore. \\', \"After an hour and a half of focused midday conversation with herbal tea: What do you think about sex, drugs & rock \\'n\\'roll?\", \"Ernst: I will be able to answer this question better after our next tour. I still think it\\'s a myth, but you always hear relevant stories. If you hang out with the tour manager of Bushido, for example, it becomes clear: Somewhere this is still happening, and there are things that are so bad that you can\\'t even imagine them. \", \"The excess isn\\'t picture book fundamentally foreign?\", \"Ernst: No, logically not. That sounds like we\\'re still college students! But I think that sex, drugs & rock \\'n\\' roll have moved into the electronic halls. On the other hand: rock \\'n\\' roll? Anyway! We all drink too much, and girls look too. \", \"But you\\'re just looking?\", \"Ernst: Last summer we thought: Here we go! Every night at a festival! But then you sit on the tour bus again two hours after the performance, on the way to the next performance. I think this lifestyle has something to do with luxury, and you have to fight it first. Let\\'s see what the next level brings. F\", \\'To the plate\\', \\'Schick Schock The first line of the new picture book album is the first quote: \"Welcome to the Jungle\" sends dear greetings to the US-Mofametal-dump rubber Guns N\\\\\\' Roses. But this ends the reference again. Picture book \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is a cool funk-feger, cut and danceable. The rest of the album unites hand-knitted R-\\\\\\'n\\\\\\'-B beats and metal guitars, bold slogan texts with casual nonsense as well as hip-hop groove with electronic toys and chic scratched high-gloss pop. Picture book trick: They replace classic songwriting with sleepy crafting. Picture book Happiness: Not only the hit singles included in all of them, but also the album length is excellent (available from 20. 2. )\\', \\'Picture book live: Arena, 1. 4. (sold out); Arena Open Air (18. 6. ). Other dates: Innsbruck (11. 3. ), Salzburg (12. 3. ), Graz (13. 3. ), Linz (14. 3. )\\', \\'To the volume\\', \\'Picture book was created in 2005 as a student band in Kremsmünster (OÖ). After \"Nelken & Schillinge\" (2009) and \"Die Pest in Piemont\" (2011), two ambitious, but rather unexciting, indie guitar albums, the quartet reinvented itself in 2013 as a pop band with the license to casual border crossing. Above all, the song \"Maschin\" caused a stir with its minimalist video\\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\"Beate Meinl-Reisinger, top candidate of the Neos, could play an important role in the City Hall of Vienna after this Viennese election campaign. If one believes in the recent polls, then SPÖ and Greens may no longer create a majority. That could be Meinl-Reisinger\\'s hour. The Neos could become the third in the league, Meinl-Reisinger City Councilwoman. So who is this woman, and what does she want to achieve politically? How does she see her past today as the press spokesperson of Christine Marek, the ÖVP politician who wanted to score points with resentment against foreigners in the last Viennese election campaign? A trip with the 71s gives insights. \", \\'Walter: Have you ever been caught driving black?\\', \"Beate Meinl-Reisinger: Once, that was totally annoying. I went home with my three-day-old child from the pediatrician two stations by tram and just didn\\'t buy a ticket. \", \\'Do you drive a lot of publics?\\', \"Meinl-Reisinger: I used to not. I did a lot of cycling. At that time I always had environmental tickets, they don\\'t exist anymore, which is a pity. Today I have an annual ticket, but ride a lot with my pedal scooter - I can also take it with me to the public. \", \\'Why are we meeting here at the stock exchange, why are we taking the 71?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: I live here near the ninth district, but I grew up in this area, my parents live right around the corner until today. And my school, the high school in Wasagasse, is also close to here. In addition, the 71er drives past the town hall, where I would like to work after the Vienna election. He drives over the ring to Simmering. There you see many sides of the city. At the end you end up at the central cemetery, where an ancestor of mine is buried, who founded the first kindergarten favorite in the 19th century. \\', \\'How was your schooling?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: I liked going to school very much and also had great teachers who gave us a lot for life. I fortunately never had problems in school. I maturated in 1996, only last year we had a normal operation in school. We had construction site for almost eight years because the school had sunk towards the Danube Canal. Here in the area there are many underground streams, as had sunk a lot, especially around Hörlgasse. It is by the way named after Josef Georg Hörl, the long-serving mayor of Vienna, he was 31 years in power. Michael Häupl is second, he has been mayor for 21 years. But Hörl has carried out an administrative reform in contrast to Häupl. \\', \"In your public communication, you have the impression that you are especially against Heinz-Christian Strache. Isn\\'t that a blow to the water? Your competition is more like the greens. \", \"Meinl-Reisinger: It is important to me to say that I will not make H. -C. Strache the mayor. But we also criticise what goes wrong in the city government. For example, through the Greens. They have not changed anything with their government participation in Vienna that the SPÖ operates in Vienna in a way that I call corruption. Public contracts are placed at the party\\'s disposal. In addition, you often cannot distinguish between the city and the SPÖ Vienna in communication. \", \\'Who are the Neos voters?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: Many young people. People who want changes, who see that the neos are the young force of change. \\', \\'What\\\\\\'s that supposed to be, \"the young force of change\"?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: These are the many self-employed, boys, parents with small children, but also the elderly, who want to get the movement into the political system. At an event, a man told me that he himself did not choose the Neos, but his 85-year-old mother, because she says the Neos worked for the next generation. \\', \\'Speaking of generations, will you one day inherit something?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: I have not thought about this at all, I wish my parents a long life. What I inherit is the interest in education, history, culture, the love of travelling, camping holidays. \\', \\'I have my assets. \\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: What kind of question is that? My parents are in their 60s. \\', \\'What was your first job?\\', \"Meinl-Reisinger: After the Matura I worked in a supermarket. In the Emma shop, there is no more. I worked there in the first year of my studies, how long exactly, I don\\'t remember. First I was in the branch Wipplingerstraße in the city center, later also in Garrisongasse in the ninth district and in the Anastasius-Grün-Gasse in the 18th district. \", \\'What have you suffered the least from this work?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: Putting the freezer in was exhausting, because it became quite cold over time. And then just ovens were installed, with which the bread was baked in the branch. When they were finished, the thing beeped until it was opened. But otherwise it was a decent job, where you chop something, I liked to work there. \\', \\'How are you at the Sunday opening?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: From my point of view, this question is always wrongly discussed in Vienna, because it is always only about the tourist zones, but I believe that it is also about the Viennese people. I think it is also about the freedom of entrepreneurs to decide when to lock them up - with strong worker protection. In any case, there is a possibility to cover up with the most necessary things, to buy milk, bread or a bottle of wine quickly in the evening. That is what exists in Brussels at every corner. \\', \\'You lived there for almost two years. \\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: It was a great experience, very international. But there was a high fluctuation. People came and went. I first worked there for the Chamber of Commerce in the EU Commission and later for EU Parliamentarian Othmar Karas (ÖVP, note) as an assistant. \\', \\'Did you claim an Erasmus scholarship as part of your studies?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: No, unfortunately. During Jus studies, you can only do European and international law abroad, and that fell into a phase of my studies, where I wanted to finish quickly. I had a hanger in civil law and had to balance it. At some point I said you had to sit on your four letters and learn. \\', \\'They also worked for other ÖVPlers, such as Christine Marek. Compared to ÖVP, the Neos represent other positions. \\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: The ÖVP wants to maintain the Gymnasium. Okay, but the future of the city only decides along the question of the quality of the compulsory schools. And I think the separation at ten years is too early. Here, too, it is not chosen according to performance, but according to the socio-economic background. \\', \\'Five years ago, you were quoted in the standard with the words: \"Heterogeneous classes do not work in practice. The teacher orients himself to the weaker ones. The gifted should not sit in the class and fad. \" Do you still see this as it is today?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: I know which sentence you mean. He ends with: \"says the speaker of Christine Marek. \" I said what I had to say, but I criticized it internally. Christine Marek can confirm that. As a press officer, it was my job to communicate her opinion rather than my personal opinion. \\', \\'One of your two daughters was trained this year, and what criteria did you use to choose the school she went to?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: I have looked at many schools. As a working mother I wanted a full-day school and I wanted to give my child to a public school. In our vicinity there is no full-day public school, so she now attends a private school. My children have also gone to a private kindergarten, because also there we had problems to get a place in the public institutions. Many mothers have these difficulties. Because there are too few public offers, parents have to register some children for a kindergarten place, which are not yet born. That is also a psychological burden. And something that we criticize. \\', \\'How should children of refugees be integrated into everyday school life?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: I think that this should not be centrally specified. This must be decided by the school location itself. If two children come into a class, then these children can be taken integrally. If there are 15 children in a school level, a preparatory class will probably be useful. \\', \\'How can you avoid children focusing on some schools?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: It is important that the children attend a school close to their home. Most parents also want this. After primary school, i. e. from upper secondary level 1, parents could make voluntary offers to send the children to school in another part of town. Sweden does that, and this is also a recommendation from Heidi Schrodt in her book \"Migration and Education\". \\', \\'How do you assess the actions of the City of Vienna in the current refugee crisis?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: In Vienna everything was quite fine, for example, that children from Traiskirchen were accepted. It is nice to see how great the willingness to help is. I myself was also at the Westbahnhof and helped. It gives hope to see how much civil society makes. But now the situation has changed again. Politics must make and act at all levels - regional, national, but also European. \\', \\'Which book did you always start, but never finish?\\', \\'Meinl-Reisinger: \"Die 40 Tage des Musa Dagh\" by Franz Werfel. The book is very good, but I just keep putting it away. \\', \\'The person\\', \\'Beate Meinl-Reisinger, born in 1978, was born in Vienna and grew up in the Inner City. She attended the high school in Wasagasse in Vienna-Alsergrund. Among other things, the lawyer worked as an assistant to the EU Member of Parliament Othmar Karas (ÖVP), as well as Christine Marek, the former top candidate of the Vienna ÖVP. Meinl-Reisinger belongs to the founding team of the Neos\\', \\'Next episode: Falter editor Benedikt Narodoslawsky with the top candidate of the Greens, Maria Vassilakou, in the 43rd\\', \\'ON THE STRECKE: Interviews on the Vienna election 2015\\', \\'Start and destination\\', \\'The moth met the Viennese neos top candidate Beate Meinl-Reisinger at the station Börse of tram line 71. In this area she grew up, here she also went to high school, not far from here is also the Juridicum where she studied.

And therefore you have to do one yourself. \\', \\'That\\\\\\'s good, because the young man contradicted two of the iron principles in Vienna\\\\\\'s gastronomy, which read: \"Never do something yourself, but wait until someone else does it\" and \"If you do something yourself, then only where the others do it. \" But maybe Matthias Hagrer didn\\\\\\'t know (which, after years in Bernd Schlacher\\\\\\'s Kunshallen-Café and in Daun-Kinsky-Clubbing, is rather improbable), or they just didn\\\\\\'t care. Because the place where he opened his small living room corner with the programmatic name \"Bei mir\" three months ago is definitely not a bad one: wide, bright streets with minimal traffic, a few beautiful old factory buildings all around, the green Wilhelminenberg in noticeable proximity - just as Ottakring can be. \\', \\'It\\\\\\'s not easy to describe \"in my case\" because it\\\\\\'s not so much because it would escape the categories, but simply and poignantly, because the \"in my case\" is so insanely dark that you can hardly see anything. \\', \\'What you can find when using all the candlesticks and the few low-current filament lamps hanging from the ceiling, but you can find out is: a small bar room that is well visited, a small little club that is also well visited, a sofa salon that fills up only in the course of the evening, quite a lot of Eames-Chair replicas and a few used as shelves, small wooden crates on the wall. Very simple, not unpleasant, soft jazz and swing penetrate into the dark of the rooms. \\', \\'On the menu of the small restaurant you will find quite a lot: coffee from the Lower Austrian roasting shop Petrus, tea from Demmer, homemade lemonades (which are served in jam glasses), smoothies and iced teas, a few neat beers (Augustiner, Schladminger, Freistädter) as well as a few enjoyable craft beer, among others from Xaver from the immediate neighborhood. And of course, a lot of cocktails of the more classic kind, very well mixed, as experts confirm. \\', \\'In addition, there is a bit of something edible. Matthias Habringer didn\\\\\\'t really want to pay so much attention to this, now he is a little surprised, according to his own statement, how many people would take the (eh good) toasts and (no further worth mentioning) antipasti plates. Because he forgot the basic rule \"When people drink, they also want to eat\".

       "array(['[\\'It is only ten o\\\\\\'clock in the morning, but Maurice Ernst already has an extensive walk through the winter Vienna behind him. He is dressed entirely in black, his hair is brightly blond, his eyes are blue-green. A gold necklace dangles on his wrist, a sports car flinser shines in the left earlobe. The 26-year-old is extremely polite and impressively communicative. He speaks almost without point and comma, his hands speak with him, and he likes to underline statements with the phrase \"point, end, out\". \\', \\'He founded his band Bilderbuch ten years ago as a monastic student in Kremsmünster. Two albums between German-speaking indie pop and ambitious thinker rock brought respectful successes, two singles in 2013 the stylistic reinvention and the breakthrough: \"Plansch\" and \"Maschin\" became hits far beyond the local indie scene, the Bilderbuch opened the German festival stages; the feuilleton reacted euphorically. \\', \\'\"This music is awesome because it\\\\\\'s awesome,\" wrote the Süddeutsche Zeitung, and the same applies to the album \"Schick Schock\", which will be released on February 20th on the band\\\\\\'s own label Maschin Records: Maurice Ernst lets Falco run wild, and picture books give Austrian pop what he missed for so long: a proper portion of sex appeal. \\', \\'Falter: Mr. Ernst, when does your alarm clock ring?\\', \\'Maurice Ernst: Today he was set to ten to eight, but I have already woken up. We have to use the days until the release of the album really. If you have your own label and want to have your fingers in the game as a band everywhere, you have to spend a lot of time and discipline. Because just every detail is important. \\', \"So you\\'re not just an artist, you\\'re also a responsible entrepreneur?\", \\'Ernst: \"Entrepreneur\" isn\\\\\\'t really true, but being an artist is now more than just art. You have to take responsibility to get to where you want to go. \"I\\\\\\'m a musician, and behind me the flood,\" it doesn\\\\\\'t go on anymore. Of course, it\\\\\\'s just about music in phases, but then it\\\\\\'s about artwork, the live implementation, the conception of videos and so on. I\\\\\\'m bad at handing things out because I don\\\\\\'t really trust anyone. \\', \\'So more success means more responsibility and more burden?\\', \\'Ernst: You adapt to a new situation and try to balance quantity and quality without betraying its principles. Suddenly everything goes faster. We come now for example to the Bravo hits sampler. I would have been happy about it for a week because I have always heard it as a child. Now this is only a quick mail, and you are in the head again somewhere else. \\', \\'The alternative band on the Teeniepop CD, how does that fit?\\', \\'Ernst: When we were with \"Maschin\" at \"Welcome to Austria\", Stermann/Grissemann asked us how they should tell us. At this moment it was a very conscious decision to say \"as a pop band\". Also out of defiance, because I was fed up with this eternal \"The Next Indie Band from Austria\"-Blabla. Our music is bigger than this indie thing and this petty Austrian thinking, I thought to myself. \\', \\'The system \"Alternative Pop\" or the system \"Austrian scene\"?\\', \\'Ernst: Both. Genreically, we took more liberties because we realized that we have no limits. Pop brings music to the zeitgeist, he can use clichés of all directions. It\\\\\\'s not only about the sound, but also about the attitude behind it and how to use the music history for his own music. US rapper Kanye West was an important influence. He collaged his hip-hop with elements of European music, and we thought: Hey, we can try that the other way around! That\\\\\\'s exactly what we did with songs like \"Plansch\" and \"Machin\". \\', \\'Did you realize what you had in your hand when those songs were finished?\\', \"Ernst: That might sound bad now, but we thought to ourselves: Fuck, we haven\\'t heard something like that in German in a long time. If anything! How it came to this is hard to explain in detail, you just think: Cool that this happened. Let\\'s just leave things to do!\", \"Ö3 doesn\\'t play your music anyway. \", \\'Ernst: Unlike German stations like Bayern 3, SRF 3 or Eins Live, yes. But then you have to say: I shit on Ö3, because I\\\\\\'m bigger than the system! There are many examples of what\\\\\\'s wrong in Austria in terms of pop. Smiling doesn\\\\\\'t do anything. You have to work on yourself, you have to try something, and you can\\\\\\'t let yourself get irritated. Of course, you need luck and the right moment, but we had that with \"Mashin\". This song made it possible for us to stand up and take a bit of a role model. \\', \\'Is there a tradition in Austrian pop that picture books refer to?\\', \"Ernst: There are parallels between us and Wanda on this point. We\\'re starting to grow up now, it\\'s no longer a child\\'s birthday party. That\\'s why you have the size to deal with Austrian pop history. In the zero years, you had international role models and didn\\'t want to have anything to do with Austrian pop culture. Yes, no quote, no distance! There was something like Ernst Molden or The Nino from Vienna, of course, and that\\'s great, but it\\'s not pop in that sense, it\\'s rather petty art. \", \\'How is it that you and Wanda suddenly think and act differently?\\', \\'Ernst: This has to do with the emancipation of this generation. They say: FM4 good and beautiful, alternative -super, it took it all to be where we are. But now you can start to be naughty. There Peter Cornelius appears, as a Falco quote, and at the next moment you buy the edge from the fendrich and say: \"We are the new Schickeria!\" Point, end, out. It\\\\\\'s about showing: Hey, we are the new heroes!\\', \\'Are you going to find Peter Cornelius too?\\', \\'Ernst: In our song \"Om\" the quotation \"Reif für die Insel\" occurs. But that\\\\\\'s all I mean by \"find\". \\', \\'Unlike Falco, right?\\', \\'Ernst: Falco is actually the only Austrian musician who has had a halo for us as a teenager. After \"Plansch\" and \"Maschin\" Falco covers were produced everywhere in Germany. Logically, our music sounds more like a world, our lyrics also allow something to be said, as with Falco is also a bit hip-hop in it. If this closeness is constantly told you, you can either deny it, or you deal with it. Refusing does not matter, Falco was super-class. Now we do it like the hip-hop in America. \\', \\'What does that mean?\\', \"Ernst: Help yourself where you feel that it\\'s right, move it and get it to a new point. That\\'s our access. Falco is not so far from Kanye West. Falco was actually an overcrowded idiot. For me, this is a very natural development. It\\'s really fun to play with the conditions in Austria right now. \", \\'Speaking of playing: In the video for \"Maschin\" you play with luxury and arrogance. Where did you get the star of the video, the bright yellow sports car?\\', \"Ernst: I went to the bottom of all of Austria\\'s Lamborghini owners. After a long search it turned out that three yellow Lamborghini Diablo in St. Georgen are standing on the Attersee, and one of them we got for the video. It was important that it will be exactly this car, because it meets the design and the spirit of the time that we wanted. The beauty of Lamborghini is that it corresponds to the cliché of the sports car, but with far less prejudice than Ferrari or Porsche. \", \\'Is the Lamborghini Diablo your dream car?\\', \"Ernst: No. I think Italian cars are great, but that\\'s not a car that you can do something with. I must be smart enough to make a bird like that. As a person living in the city, I don\\'t have a car at all, it would only devour money. \", \\'\"Maschin\" became a hit not least through the striking video. A hit, however, that does not run on Ö3. The channel was the most important medium for the domestic pop of the 70s and 80s, today this applies to FM4. Only FM4 is a niche program. \\', \"Ernst: With FM4 you can never start with the criticism, but with what it is worth. FM4 is the reason why there is such a pop-cultivated underground scene at all. Germany, for example, has no comparable channel of this size. This is also noticeable by the music that is created there: Either it tends towards the avant-garde, or it\\'s flat shit. In Austria you can keep your peculiarities, and FM4 plays you nevertheless, if the quality is right. And it\\'s only about them, not about a sound, a certain format. At some point FM4 is also the lid, that\\'s true. \", \\'What is the way out?\\', \\'Ernst: The step abroad. For bands like Wanda and Bilderbuch: If we only had Austria, that would be our gravestone. So I like to be a hero on FM4, and in Germany and Switzerland I swim with you quite normally, because there we run now also once between Lady Gaga and George Michael. \\', \\'What do you think about the much-discussed radio quota for Austrian music?\\', \"Ernst: I find this sad in a music landscape that Germany is looking very jealously at. I want them to make a quota, but of course a quota doesn\\'t say anything about the choice of music. Maybe there should be more editorial decisions again and less format? In Germany everyone is asking what\\'s going on in Austrian pop, while the big decision makers are just shrugging their shoulders here. At the moment, it would be the moment to present Austrian music confidently. Imagine that picture books would be playing on the big stage of the Frequency Festival at 8 pm and that would also get an adequate gig!\", \\'Why is that so unrealistic?\\', \"Ernst: Because the Austrian big festival event is politically a complete crux. Let\\'s consider how many Austrian bands have played on the big two festival stages in the last ten years. \", \\'So you mean the Frequency in St. Pölten and the Burgenland Nova Rock. \\', \"Ernst: Let\\'s just talk about the frequency - the FM4 frequency, in which one would like to think that it has something to do with FM4. The frustration as an Austrian pop musician comes not only from the radio, the small-mindedness of the own scene and the lack of perspective, the frustration comes also from the festivals. There is a mafia behind it, which gets competition by new organizers only this year after many monopoly years. \", \"Who\\'s this Mafia?\", \\'Ernst: Let\\\\\\'s call them by name: Skaler, the company responsible for Nova Rock and Frequency. We always call Skaler in the band \"Mafia\", because it feels a bit like that. They play a pretty hard game with Austrian bands, so we make our own open air in the arena this year. We don\\\\\\'t need Frequency. Either cleverly or not at all. Point, end, out. \\', \"Isn\\'t the uncritical audience part of the problem? Frequency is one of the most frightful festivals in the German-speaking world, but it\\'s still full again and again. \", \"Ernst: The responsibility lies with the people who are at the lever. People tell their opinions anyway. They write into the forum, ask for them, and the artists also become louder and louder. There we are again at the point that you have to be a musician above the system. That\\'s the same with Amadeus. You can scold about this prize, you can refuse it and not go because they have written your name wrong. Bullshit! You have to go, you have to get this trophy, and you have to say: This trophy is worth something because I get it!\", \\'Picture book were nominated in 2014 in four Amadeus categories, but then it became only the \"FM4 Alternative Award\". \\', \\'Ernst: I\\\\\\'m sure I won\\\\\\'t say that they fucked us up right now, but it\\\\\\'s funny when even the people responsible at the award ceremony start to wonder, \"How did that happen?\"\\', \\'Anna F. was also surprised that she was awarded the \"Song of the Year\" and not a picture book for \"Maschin\". \\', \\'Ernst: Kanye West once went on stage when Taylor Swift got a video award. \"That\\\\\\'s a fucking bullshit, because Beyoncé did the coolest video of the last 20 years,\" he said. I could have done that too, but that\\\\\\'s bullshit. You can only laugh about it. The next day, the Kronen Zeitung writes again: \"Dreamer of the day was Christina Stürmer. \" We were the most nominee band in 2014, but media like the Krone didn\\\\\\'t even mention it. Now Wanda with four Amadeus nominations are in the same position. Maybe it changes this year. The point is: we just have to increase the pressure and make it clear that we can\\\\\\'t do it without us anymore. \\', \"After an hour and a half of focused midday conversation with herbal tea: What do you think about sex, drugs & rock \\'n\\'roll?\", \"Ernst: I will be able to answer this question better after our next tour. I still think it\\'s a myth, but you always hear relevant stories. If you hang out with the tour manager of Bushido, for example, it becomes clear: Somewhere this is still happening, and there are things that are so bad that you can\\'t even imagine them. \", \"The excess isn\\'t picture book fundamentally foreign?\", \"Ernst: No, logically not. That sounds like we\\'re still college students! But I think that sex, drugs & rock \\'n\\' roll have moved into the electronic halls. On the other hand: rock \\'n\\' roll? Anyway! We all drink too much, and girls look too. \", \"But you\\'re just looking?\", \"Ernst: Last summer we thought: Here we go! Every night at a festival! But then you sit on the tour bus again two hours after the performance, on the way to the next performance. I think this lifestyle has something to do with luxury, and you have to fight it first. Let\\'s see what the next level brings. F\", \\'To the plate\\', \\'Schick Schock The first line of the new picture book album is the first quote: \"Welcome to the Jungle\" sends dear greetings to the US-Mofametal-dump rubber Guns N\\\\\\' Roses. But this ends the reference again. Picture book \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is a cool funk-feger, cut and danceable. The rest of the album unites hand-knitted R-\\\\\\'n\\\\\\'-B beats and metal guitars, bold slogan texts with casual nonsense as well as hip-hop groove with electronic toys and chic scratched high-gloss pop. Picture book trick: They replace classic songwriting with sleepy crafting. Picture book Happiness: Not only the hit singles included in all of them, but also the album length is excellent (available from 20. 2. )\\', \\'Picture book live: Arena, 1. 4. (sold out); Arena Open Air (18. 6. ). Other dates: Innsbruck (11. 3. ), Salzburg (12. 3. ), Graz (13. 3. ), Linz (14. 3. )\\', \\'To the volume\\', \\'Picture book was created in 2005 as a student band in Kremsmünster (OÖ). After \"Nelken & Schillinge\" (2009) and \"Die Pest in Piemont\" (2011), two ambitious, but rather unexciting, indie guitar albums, the quartet reinvented itself in 2013 as a pop band with the license to casual border crossing.

       "array(['[\\'The fact that the story of creation is in the bacon dumpling, the nature of humanity can be explained with the Germknödel and a napkin dumpling is a napkin dumpling, was recently carried out at this point. A species of dumplings must still be treated. \\', \\'The fact that these do not remain unnoticed is due to the attention of Julia Fuchs. Fuchs appears in this sheet as a photographer, but can do much more than photograph. For example, make films and knit caravans. She is also Vorarlberger, which does not necessarily produce talents, but possibly promotes them. As a Vorarlberger Julia F. referred me to the baked semolina dumpling as a culinary medium for understanding a way of life. \\', \\'In order to understand this, we have to deal with the semolina. This is one of the cheapest nutrients and is therefore predestined for the preparation of inexpensive dishes with high saturation potential. Cheap and satiety sounds multiplicity capable. The Krux is in the word \"preparation\". Since one has to prepare semolina before consumption (if one is not a bird), it has disappeared in urban habitats from the image area. In the cities mostly no longer prepared, but went to eat. At most something is pushed into the oven or into the microwave. Highest noodles cooked. Therefore, hardly anyone in our cities knows how to make semolina nooks for soup inserts. The same remains with modern cooking instructions such as \"Lafer! Lights! Delicious\" untreated, so it does not exist for the digitized generation. \\', \\'The care of a special dumpling knowledge therefore points to a special way of being of the knowledgeable. Where, for example, Innviertler dumplings with bacon fills are present, the discussions at the tavern table are better not carried out until the end. \\', \\'The living existence of baked semolina dumplings, on the other hand, can easily be understood as a sign of the virtuous self-limitation of its producers. Also as proof that Vorarlbergers are able to endure more than those of behind the mountain. Who of these would, like Vorarlbergers, fit into a bar for breakfast, namely a heap of semolina roasted by the fire with the calorie balance of an avalanche discharge? And who would not perish from the stronger existence of a baked semolina dumpling in the beef soup if he had not grown up with it?\\', \\'And so the baked semolina dumpling tells us a story. Also that of a Vorarlberg heroine named Fanni Amann. She has brought the cooking culture of her space between book covers and also preserved the baked semolina dumpling for posterity. In the preface to the first edition of her cookbook (1931) she also finds admonishing words that are more up-to-date today than ever before. Amann writes: \"How do I become a good cook? No price without sweat! And who thinks that cooking would be quite nice if only the work were not done, he doesn\\\\\\'t know how much work has contributed to the happiness and success of our lives. \"\\', \\'In the sense of gender equality treatment, it should be noted that man can also become a good cook by sweating and kitchen work. For example, by putting on the meal dumpling preparation a little more elaborately than Fanni Amann. Heroin is limited to four lines in the description and thus does not fully exploit the potential of this dumpling: 1⁄2 liters of milk, 5 deca butter and salt can be cooked. 15 stir in deca semolina until the porridge dissolves from the pan, arrange in a bowl, let cool, mix with 1-2 eggs. Form dumplings and cook for 10 minutes in the soup. \\', \\'We add: semolina before further processing \"linden\", i. e. roast in the dry pan at low heat. Thus, the semolina releases significantly more aroma. Only then continue as described, but the semolina mass a little more refined seasoning -namely with nutmeg and/or ground cardamom. \\', \\'And we want to cook the dumplings in salted water so that we can use them as a side dish after baking and not just as a inlay. For example, a asparagus ragout with powerful butter.

It\\\\\\'s obviously not the first beer of the day. The two musicians are in good shape, the shame runs, the posture signals relaxation. She doesn\\\\\\'t care that the interview should have started long ago, but it takes twice as long as agreed. \\', \\'Oliver Welter, the guitarist and singer, founded Naked Lunch in 1990 in Klagenfurt, the bassist Herwig Zamernik joined the band in 1993, named after a famous novel by William S. Burroughs. In the 90s, the era of grunge, Britpop and alternative rock, Naked Lunch rattled by a world career, at the turn of the millennium her world lay in ruins: record contract away, drummer away, money away, all dreams burst. \\', \\'Since the comeback album \"Songs for the Exhausted\" (2004) Naked Lunch, the sturdiness, melancholy, departure and world-poor gestures play so wonderfully to one, but constantly in the best form. Last about 2013 on the album \"All Is Fever\" and quite up to date with the soundtrack to the Unterweger film \"Jack\". The band celebrates the 25th birthday with the work show \"The Singles Collection\" (see box) as well as a few concerts. \\', \\'Falter: In our last conversation almost three years ago, it was almost exclusively about Carinthia. Today, we leave politics out, right?\\', \\'Herwig Zamernik: Just as you want. But this time we can also talk about Vienna. \\', \\'Oliver Welter: Please no, no way!\\', \"That\\'s what I thought, it\\'s supposed to be about 25 years of Naked Lunch. What\\'s the date in the birth certificate of the band?\", \"Welter: (Laughs) What kind of a wide-ranging question is that? A student of German studies, theatre studies or philosophy, who then failed in Foucault and Heidegger, probably speaks? But I can\\'t do anything about it. No band in the world has a birth certificate, and I can\\'t remember the foundation. \", \\'Probably not the first band rehearsal either?\\', \"Welter: I\\'m afraid not. Do you remember how your first day in high school was?\", \"Besides, I was in high school, you didn\\'t start Naked Lunch when I was ten years old. \", \"Welter: Well, you\\'re right. Then stop the first sex - can you remember that?\", \\'Yeah, sure. \\', \\'Welter: Seriously?\\', \"I\\'m afraid not. \", \\'Zamernik: However, I can also remember my first sex. \\', \"Welter: I\\'m afraid Naked Lunch won\\'t get off well in the butterfly this time. \", \\'I just try the next question: What was there first, the name or the band?\\', \\'Welter: The band. I would never call them Naked Lunch again today. This was only due to the fact that I was an extreme Beatnik literature aficionado and that the Burroughs book was permanently stuck in my back pocket. However, our first demo cassette, which was created in the rehearsal room, still ran under the name Lucky Strikes Again. \\', \\'Zamernik: But that should never come out!\\', \"Welter: Oh, no matter. I didn\\'t know anyone in Vienna at the time and sent the cassette on good luck to Karin Löffler of the U4. She found us great and offered us a concert in the pre-program of the Screaming Trees in the Vienna scene. We had never played live at this time, and then right in Vienna, in front of one of the then most casual US bands ever! Their only condition was that we change our name overnight. \", \\'But Naked Lunch is good!\\', \"Welter: No, because he just doesn\\'t stand for the band, but for the literary template. Wanda did well not to call himself Moby Dick. \", \"25 years later, Naked Lunch still exists. It\\'s not exactly rock \\'n\\' roll typical to get old as a band. \", \"Welter: Rock \\'n\\'Roll has a natural expiration date. Everyone who understands himself beyond the 30 as Rock \\'n\\'Roll is just ridiculous. That\\'s a privilege of youth, and that\\'s how it should be. You go there, create a band, open the amplifiers and play. Just because we\\'re drinking a few beers here right now, we\\'re not Rock \\'n\\'Roll, we\\'re fathers. Fathers still prefer to play concerts rather than do a nine-to-five job. \", \"Zamernik: It\\'s not that banal, just because nobody gives me a nine-to-five job. \", \\'How does it feel to become a quarter of a century old as a band and to look back with a compilation of old songs?\\', \"Welter: We are not nostalgic people. If our record company hadn\\'t drawn our attention to this anniversary, it would have passed us unnoticed. Surprisingly, however, this review feels incredibly good and it\\'s actually fun to reflect on our story. It doesn\\'t have to do with melancholy and nostalgia, nor do I regret anything. It\\'s simply a collection of memories and thoughts that are in total casual. \", \\'Is the work in progress?\\', \\'Welter: Of course I think of some of them: \"Well!\" But if a Nobel Prize winner would illuminate his work, he would say the same thing. This does not only concern the work of Naked Lunch, Wanda or a brass band from Obersammelsdorf, but everyone who is artistically active. As a reflected person, you will always find things that you would have left better or done differently. But the band is not for nothing where it is today. We don\\\\\\'t sell millions of records, but we can do and leave what we want. That\\\\\\'s due to diligence and perseverance and perhaps also to talent. Point, out. \\', \\'Her debut with a big record company in 1997 was the extra modest title \"Superstardom\". Why didn\\\\\\'t you end up with the superstart?\\', \"Zamernik: Because we were too stupid. From today\\'s point of view, this phase was also ok, at that time it looked quite different. We also hid this time for a long time. Like in a partnership in which, despite some missteps, you stick to the relationship because you know what you have in it. \", \\'Welter: Go please, this isn\\\\\\'t psychoanalysis! Up to \"Superstardom\" the band was only haunted by luck. The first demo immediately makes for a cool first appearance in Vienna, the second one comes a German label and wants to release it immediately without any change. A year later you are in England and only get told how great you are, half a year later the same happens in New York. So it always went on, and suddenly the really fat guys showed up. Our trip went up and all we had to do was write a few songs. \\', \"Zamernik: Only then we suddenly started talking about hairstyles. And that\\'s exactly why it\\'s a missed time: we didn\\'t deal with the essentials, but with nonsenses. After that it took us a long time to get back to normal. \", \\'Welter: All these manager types of the big labels came to Klagenfurt to smear our honey around our mouths. Then the mechanisms of the business rolled over us. You start as a country egg in Klagenfurt and suddenly you\\\\\\'re in New York at Times Square at the most expensive hotel - and when you check in you\\\\\\'ll also be told: \"One week ago there was Oasis. You guys are like Oasis!\" Then you, who just stood in the dirty basement in Klagenfurt, go to the luxury tasting room where Bruce Springsteen worked in front of you, and a stretch limousine is ready for you in front of the hotel. \\', \\'Zamernik: It had nothing to do with what it always went on at the beginning and fortunately also after this phase. What you actually burn for. In between were hairstyles. Ridiculous. \\', \\'Welter: During the creation of \"Superstardom\" we were in San Francisco and one in New York, in the same studio where Nirvana had already recorded. Then we went on to London to the studio of Ray Davies from the Kinks, and then the record company flies you for a video shoot to Brazil - horny! When we came back from this world, my girlfriend only said: \"You\\\\\\'ve become an arrogant asshole!\"\\', \\'Oasis have built a world career on arrogance and depperty. \\', \"Welter: Yes, but Oasis really had the attitude, we just thought about it. Our arrogance was a mistake, but their arrogance was born completely naturally from the British workers\\' town of Manchester. \", \\'At the turn of the millennium, Naked Lunch seemed to be at the end, but your best records were only to follow. Is the cliché true that it is good for art when the artist is in bad shape?\\', \\'Zamernik: As initial ignition yes, as a permanent solution no. \\', \"Welter: Let\\'s say this: It is not an obstacle once you have landed in the Gatsch. Of course, this does not mean that you constantly maintain the hardship and misery. The clichéd image of the suffering, dying artist is boring. Immediately in need you don\\'t give anything, the creative creation takes place in the reflection. \", \\'25 years of Naked Lunch - with Wolfgang Ambros asked: How does that end, how will this go on?\\', \"Welter: I don\\'t know. We would certainly be more careerist if we were constantly thinking about how to work well. At some point we will make a new album, maybe even next year. For this we have to get back together again, because we don\\'t know where the journey is going yet. \", \\'In conclusion, to ask something political: the world is now acting like hardly before. How would you answer the question \"How does that stop, how will this go on?\"\\', \"Zamernik: There are enough reasons to be afraid, that\\'s all I can say. Everything seems to be going in the wrong direction. In view of this, it feels almost silly to think about daily business. Sit down and write a pop song at the moment seems rather ridiculous to me. At the same time, however, I don\\'t want to make a purely social-critical album like Neil Young recently. \", \\'Welter: I think we have to continue our daily work quite normally. In my life, the social and political upheavals change very little. In a fatalistic way, I find it even exciting: there are hardly any approaches for solutions, but only fainting. For a fundamentally not necessarily positive thinking person like me, this scenario has a certain appeal. \\', \\'Zamernik: With me, the appeal is limited, and unfortunately, it does not change the fact that the Orbáns and Straches of this world abuse all these processes for their populist purposes. Only: whoever chooses fascists gets fascism, and every fence is a further step in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, we \"left-wings\" are not immune from getting to deal with the fear when it is said that \"Islam floods us\", because there are enough reasons to fear Islamic fundamentalism. Moreover, every other fundamentalism as well. \\', \\'Welter: The categories \"left\" and \"right\" begin to blur. No one knows where to go, not even Slavoj Žižek knows more. \\', \\'Zamernik: I think that leftists also have to stand up for the haxes and say: \"I stand with my soul and body for our Western culture, for emancipation, freedom of expression and human rights. Whoever comes and wants to undermine this must be offered paroli. \"\\', \\'But you, as a leftist, do not know whether you should work for equality between women or for freedom of religion?\\', \"Zamernik: Yes, I know that very well. I stand up for both, 100 percent. Because that\\'s possible, and I think it\\'s also up to people like us to do that and not just leave the field to the right-wing heretics. \", \\'Live: 8. 11.

       "array(['[\\'I was born in 2000 in a small village near Kabul, before the outbreak of the war, before the attacks of September 11. We were initially a normal family. However, my father was murdered by the Taliban and my mother stood alone with us. She tied carpets in our house and six women helped her. A man then brought the carpets to Pakistan and sold them. We also had animals that I fed as a child. \\', \\'We lived a modest life. The Taliban had the land under control, but most people had little to do with them, people living in their tribes. And we all had to accept what the Mullahs ordered us to do. We hated the Mullahs because they only thought about themselves because they had their own God who had nothing to do with Allah. Islam is for me a religion of peace and love, but the Mullahs pervert Islam. \\', \"When my father was alive, we were fine. He was a doctor, we didn\\'t miss anything. But when he was murdered, the problems began for my mother, because she couldn\\'t just go to work. She wasn\\'t allowed to just leave the house alone to work somewhere. \", \"So she stayed at home, and then neighbors came and said that she wasn\\'t allowed to bring any other women to work in her house. Then there was a distant uncle who worked for the Taliban. He wanted to marry my aunt, but we hid her. And so we attracted the Taliban\\'s anger, which our family wanted to destroy, at least we feared that. I was afraid and not hopeful. \", \"After the father\\'s death it was hard, my mother disappeared together with my little brother and my little sister - I don\\'t know where they live or if they were abducted today. If you have a conflict with the Taliban, they want to destroy your whole family. I fled to Kabul, there I was about twelve. \", \"I lived from small jobs. We washed cars on the street there, I couldn\\'t go to school anymore. I also worked in a photo studio and cleaned the floors there. The man there taught me how to photograph, and he taught me English. I decided to run away from Afghanistan, I didn\\'t feel safe here. And that\\'s why I decided with two buddies to travel to Tehran, I wanted to take my life into my hands, learn something. \", \\'The tugs took us with them, but we also had to walk across the green border. When I arrived in Iran, I was disappointed. I wanted to go to school, but the Iranian government did not allow us. Refugees had no right to education. So I worked in a workshop where fancy bags were produced. I also worked as a shoemaker. I earned 250 euros a month, it was hard work, the boss yelled at us that we should work more. We had little time to eat something, and worked up to eleven hours every day. After all: I could save 600 euros. I decided to travel to Turkey, to Istanbul, and from there to Europe. It was a terrible trip. \\', \\'I read about the many drowned people on the Internet, I was scared and wanted to come to Europe by land. First I lived in Istanbul in the house of the people who brought me here. I also worked hard here to get further to Europe. A crossing costs about 2000 euros. I ironed tailor-made suits, which were made here for fine gentlemen in Europe. It was good work. I liked life in Turkey, but I wanted to go to school and that didn\\\\\\'t go. So I decided to go to Austria, because I read that it is a neutral country and that the refugees are well treated. I lived in an Afghan community in Turkey and we looked for the countries like a job. Some said, \"I\\\\\\'m going to Sweden\", others wanted to go to Germany or Denmark. \\', \\'I was afraid because I saw on TV how many people were drowning, and I had no one to hold my hand. I was only 14 years old. I therefore did not want to go by ship to the Greek islands. But also the trip on the country way was dangerous. I saw death in the eyes. \\', \\'We were about 20 people when we left. It was dark when we left Istanbul, it was cold, really cold, it was snowing and we wandered through a dark forest for five days. I thought that I would never survive this journey, the forest was darker, it was bitter cold, the food was used up. We had to climb across cross-country trees and through bushes and rivers. There were men with big axes who cleared our way. I thought that I would never arrive. Some of us ran over the ice of the rivers, people then broke into the ice-cold water. They survived fortunately, but the clothes afterwards were wet. It was so ice-cold that I freezed my clothes. Everything was frozen. \\', \"I feel so strong today because I survived it. Many of us cried, even big, strong men, because they thought the end of life had come. But we all trusted in Allah, who would save us. I didn\\'t want to cry, but to go on. We marched and marched. We came to a place where it was said that a car was waiting for us. We waited two hours. But then it was suddenly said that the car would not come after all, we had to go on. We could not anymore, but we had no choice. Then a small bus came and secretly took us to a small town. We were 20 boys, five were about 15 years old, a few were around 25, one was already married. \", \\'We were in Serbia, and Serbian police had stopped us and kept 30 euros from each of us. They were really cruel to us. We had to stand up in a row and they missed us slaps. The 30 euros were a bribe so that we could move on. After we had paid it, they left us in the forest. There were always families there during the escape. We carried the babies from the mothers because they could not carry them anymore. But we could not carry the children any more. We reached many small villages, and at some point we came to a car that brought us to Vienna. I read on the Internet that Austria is not a NATO member, that it is militaryly neutral since the Second World War, that the economy works well there. I like that. \\', \"It was four o\\'clock in the morning when I arrived, I was looking for a police station to apply for asylum. And I was looking for a flag. Only the sight of a flag makes refugees safe to be in Austria. Many of us are being cheated, they are told that they are in Germany or Austria and are in truth elsewhere. \", \\'I came to Traiskirchen. It was not nice there. I arrived in December, it was still quite cold. They asked me about my age. When I said \"15\", an official answered, \"I don\\\\\\'t believe you!\\', \\'Show me your papers!\" But I had none. He sent me to a doctor who made an X-ray of my hand, looked at my body and found out that I was telling the truth. \\', \"I stayed in Traiskirchen for five months. The food was terrible, we barely brought it down. Only once a month there was lasagna, my body dish. The rooms were also terrible. I wanted to go to school, but I didn\\'t get permission because I was no longer required to go to school. I suffered in Traiskirchen because I couldn\\'t sleep, I couldn\\'t learn, I couldn\\'t eat. The clothes were too big, and for 40 euros we couldn\\'t afford anything. I could only wipe the corridors for three euros per hour or work in the laundry room. Most of them started smoking in Traiskirchen, although they were only 12, 13 years old. I just sat around idle. Sometimes we played football. \", \\'In early summer it was said that I should sleep outside because families needed the place. I then came to Vienna, to Erdberg. There I did not feel safe at all. Because once I showered, other refugees came in and beat me. Another time they robbed me and devastated my room while I was in school. I went to the police and filed a complaint. But what does that do?\\', \"There were just too many guys of my age living in Erdberg and no one looked after them. I actually had my own room, but no key to lock it. Again and again, clothes were stolen from me. When they reported this, the people showed up and told you who the boss was. I was really scared in Erdberg because they threatened to give me a ride if I complained again. There were also some guys from Africa who heard loud music all day, I couldn\\'t concentrate when I wanted to do my house exercises. \", \\'In Erdberg, too, I was first told that I was not allowed to go to school. However, I was sent to the city school council. I took the subway to Herrengasse and marched to the city school council. I met a woman there who initially ran away from me. She said, \"You can\\\\\\'t go to school anymore, because you\\\\\\'re already 15. \" But she noticed that I speak English very well. I told her, \"Give me a little time, then I also learn German. \" And so she showed me a list of schools, and a woman telephoned around, and so I came here to this Simmeringer Gymnasium. They put me in fourth grade. Then I met the most adorable person of my life: my teacher and class director. \\', \\'One time my life was regulated, I could learn. And then something very unusual happened: My teacher took me in. He offered me to live with him because Erdberg was so terrible. He has become a kind of father for me. I am really happy for the first time to be part of a family. I am happy, really, really happy. My life is suddenly full of happiness. I live with my teacher, his children, his wife. \\', \\'I thank Allah for it. The darkness has come to an end. I have a plan A, I want to become a pilot. I want to try it at least. I don\\\\\\'t have a plan B yet. I am now \"extraordinary student\". I have to catch up with the stuff and learn German now. The school in Afghanistan was completely different from here. The first contrast is that girls can also learn here and that the school is so close to my home. The quality is much higher here. The teachers in Afghanistan beat us, although it was forbidden. The school students had to always wear a veil in their schools. It was not even allowed to see their eyes. Here the girls always wanted to talk to me. Here is the half class full of girls, they are nice to me. At the beginning I felt a bit ashamed, but by now it is quite normal for me. \\', \\'The first girl I talked to was Claudia, I met her on the Danube Island. She asked me where I came from and how old I was. It was really hard for me, I was shy and wanted to finish the conversation and leave. But she said: Tell me about you! I also have a good friend here in the class. We learn together. It becomes normal for me to live with girls. \\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\"Masha Gessen, 48, is probably one of the bravest journalists. The Russian-born and American-born woman, along with President Vladimir Putin, is one of his sharpest journalistic critics. The pressure on her became so great that Gessen preferred to emigrate to the USA. There she published an impressive Putin biography and a portrait of Putin\\'s artist collective Pussy Riot. The Forum for Journalism and Media Vienna (FJUM) invited Gessen to Vienna last week. With the Falter, the courageous journalist spoke about the decline of the free press in Putin\\'s Russia. \", \"Falter: Ms. Gessen, the Putin critic Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow\\'s centre, as was the Putin-critical journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Are you also afraid of your life?\", \\'Masha Gessen: No, that doesn\\\\\\'t mean that I feel safe. After all, I have the honour of being the first Russian journalist to be blacklisted by Putin\\\\\\'s people. A Russian prosecutor said to me on the phone during a research: \"You will regret it if you bring the story!\" But I\\\\\\'m known, my books have appeared in the West, that offers me protection. I live much safer than many of my colleagues. \\', \\'Which journalists are currently at risk in Moscow?\\', \\'Eat: Most of them are threatened by those whose names have never been heard in the West. They have to be afraid of being beaten up or murdered. Murders of well-known journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya are, on the other hand, a PR disaster for Russia. \\', \\'One could see with one time how it was about freedom of the press. How could it get this far after the fall of the Soviet Union?\\', \\'Eat: Putin succeeds in building a totalitarian system, and the ultimate goal of a totalitarian government is, as you know, to destroy the public arena, the public space, and thus the critical, public discourse. That is the great difference to tyranny. Tyrants force their people to follow, but they do not necessarily destroy public space. Putin has deliberately destroyed public space. \\', \\'How did he begin his work?\\', \\'Eat: He first took over all national TV stations. One of them belonged to Vladimir Gussinski. . . \\', \\'. . . a media magnate whom you describe in your Putin biography as the first \"political refugee\" under Putin. He was arrested for flimsy reasons and then left the country. \\', \\'It was an incalculable risk for Putin, he wants to control all the media, especially the television stations. Within three years, the state therefore ralled two channels, another one belonging to the energy company Gazprom, which is mostly owned by the state. The first two are now official state stations, the third is unofficially under Kremlin control and attacks critics in an even more intolerable way. \\', \\'What does that mean?\\', \\'Eat: For example, the station sends out camera teams to stalk opposition activists. When I met with an informant in the U. S. embassy, a camera team filmed me when I locked up my bicycle lock in front of the embassy. Journalists also track people at home. Often they also come together with the police - for example in house searches. \\', \"When you reported on Gussinski\\'s arrest, the phone was turned off and suddenly a man stood on a ladder in front of your apartment door 24 hours a day, saying that you were half mad at fear. \", \\'Eat: It was terrifying and I left the Russian magazine for which I had worked. I switched to the American news magazine U. S. News & World Report. I thought I was better protected there. To continue working on the Russian magazine would have been great, but it was too dangerous for me. From then on, I only wrote about Putin in the American press. \\', \\'How do Russian investigative journalists actually work?\\', \"Eat: It\\'s very difficult, because it takes considerable effort to clarify very simple matters. Because the public arena has been destroyed in the judiciary, there is no more information flow. As an investigative journalist, you are in Russia in the position to do the work of the law enforcement agency and the work of the court itself. However, these are actually not the tasks of a journalist. It is enormously grueling. \", \\'What strategies have you experienced in Russia?\\', \\'Eat: The government pursues several strategies. For example, a law was adopted that restricts foreign participation in media houses. And Putin even tries to destroy the distribution of newspapers in the country. After the terror attack in Beslan, the government issued a law that forbade the sale of newspapers near public transport. \\', \\'Why is that?\\', \\'Eat: It should be a step in the fight against terrorism - because one could hide a bomb in the kiosk. Why one should hide a bomb in a newspaper kiosk and not in a tobacco kiosk, I do not know. By measures like this, the readership of independent newspapers shrunk from hundreds of thousands to 30,000. \\', \\'How do you get to independent newspapers today?\\', \\'Eat: Most of these leaves are distributed for free in expensive coffee houses in Moscow because there is no way to sell them elsewhere. Putin has no problem with that. 30,000 people who drink expensive cappuccino in Moscow and read their own newspapers are okay for him. He has nothing to worry about, these critics are talking to each other anyway. \\', \\'At the book market, publishers are complaining about a law that allegedly protects the\\', \\'Children should serve against harmful literature. Eat: It destroys the book market. Books must now be certified in Russia, and that takes a long time. This bureaucracy makes it harder and expensive to publish books. Booksellers had no high profit margins before that. Now they are also harassed. Even the books of physicist Stephen Hawking have not been certified because they also deal with suicide and death, all things from which children are supposedly protected. \\', \\'What about the Internet?\\', \\'Eat: Putin has been trying to limit protests in Moscow for three years, for example through the Youth Protection Act. Authorities can simply get all Internet providers to block special pages. Opposition pages are censored in this way. Even my Wikipedia entries have been blocked. I can read them in the USA, but not in Russia. By closing some organizations, Putin paralyzes and scares the others. \\', \\'Are your books sold in Russia?\\', \\'Eat: No, there are no publishing houses that move them. \\', \\'Is total control threatening?\\', \"Eat: No, but a totalitarian regime doesn\\'t need total control, it\\'s a misconception. Totality is created, but it\\'s not implemented by controlling every single person at all times. \", \\'The young women of the protest group Pussy Riot, who openly criticized Putin and the state church with their actions, were all the more courageous. How difficult was the work on your book on the collective?\\', \"Eat: This book was really fun - unlike my books before - for me. In my previous works I had written about quite uncomfortable contemporaries, but Pussy Riot are great. They are still considered a punk rock group in public perception, but that\\'s not true. They are an artist collective that created the figure of a punk rock group. \", \\'The group became world-famous with its performance in the Moscow Christ-Erlöser Cathedral, in which she criticized Putin in a punk prayer and the powerful Russian Orthodox Church. Where are the beginnings of her activism?\\', \"Eat: They started with minor disruptive actions. They gave their weirdest performance in Red Square on a very cold day on a really high platform. They climbed so high because they wanted to finish their protest song. No one should have the opportunity to pull them down from there without risking his life - on the platform it was very, very slippery. So the police had to wait until the end. They took Pussy Riot with them and tried to find out who the women were at all. Were they prostitutes or protesters? It didn\\'t matter anyway, because they wanted to lock the women anyway. Finally they had disturbed them. \", \\'Anyone who reads the chapter in your book about the Kafkaesque trial and time in prison feels reminded of the Soviet show trials and the Gulag. \\', \\'Eat: The trial was worse than in the Soviet Union, because in the USSR there were at least real defenders of punishment. Criminal defense was the last way in Soviet times to criticise the system. The Pussy Riot trial was a witch trial without effective defense. The criminal defense lies completely down in all Russia. Criminal defenders are only there to hand over bribes or letters. They have access to prison and act like couriers between the families, the authorities and the prison inmates. \\', \\'How could you interview Pussy Riot?\\', \\'A friend of Marija, one of Pussy Riot, gave up his visiting time so that I could visit her and talk to her. I spoke to her two and a half hours. That was very little, but I could make an impression. I also corresponded with the others, both legally and illegally. Legally, you email them and they mail back. Illegally, you smuggle in letters about the criminal defender. Finally, Marija handed me the correspondence with her family and friends. It was very valuable because he was also very personal. \\', \\'The process was very critically reported abroad. Did this have an influence?\\', \"Eat: If the world press hadn\\'t paid attention to Pussy Riot, they would probably have died in prison. The world public has saved Pussy Riot\\'s life. They were not allowed to die. \", \\'At the moment, the eyes of the world are on the Ukraine conflict, which is also a propaganda war. You are Russian and American, you have reported again and again from war zones. Can you find anything like truth here at all?\\', \\'Essence: The biggest challenge for journalism in the war is not front reports, but the explanation of the great contexts. The US media are not able to tell the big story. \\', \\'Why?\\', \\'Eat: First, the US government does not call this conflict \"war\" but \"Putin\\\\\\'s adventure policy\". The standards of so-called objectivity are so strict in some US media that the media cannot call war \"war\" even though they see war reigning there. The second problem is that the big man\\\\\\'s addiction is initially almost ridiculous and is not taken seriously by totalitarian politicians. Hannah Arendt already addressed how difficult it was for the American media at the beginning to tell the big story about Hitler and Stalin. \\', \\'What should the big story have been?\\', \\'Eat: Hitler and his followers are a threat to humanity because they believe that the Jews are to blame for everything. And Stalin and his people are dangerous because they believe that only the workers are to survive. That sounded so ridiculous that the story was not told. \\', \\'And what is the great Putin story?\\', \"Eat: Putin is not about protecting his strategic interests in Ukraine. The real big story is: Putin is waging war for traditional values. That sounds very ridiculous and stupid. And that he is waging a war to protect Ukraine from American homofascists sounds even more stupid. So journalists don\\'t even report about it. Instead, they write about what is happening on the ground. \", \\'We would like to show you a photo. It was taken during the Olympic Games in Sochi. See: Putin drinks schnapps with Austrian officials. What do you think when you see this photo?\\', \\'Eat: Austria has learned nothing. \\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\\'When the Japanese Hokusai produced the color woodcut \"The Great Wave Before Kanagawa\" in 1830, this was part of his series on the Fuji Volcano. In the current show \"Surfing\" by Hans Weigand, it is almost impossible not to think of Hokusai\\\\\\'s classics. On a good third of his pictures, the water masses weighed and broke steeply piled up. The spray splashes, and colour shimmers over the crisp boys, which the artist sampled from copper engravings of the 16th century or from Marvel-Comics. \\', \\'Now the born Tyrolean, who cast his anchor in Vienna in 1978, is not exactly known for his painting. He was often met in the rocker pose, which he took as an e-guitarist with artists such as Pas Paravant. Weigand may come across as a painter in this show, but in truth he is a passionate picture mounter, which the original captivates less than the procedures of reproduction from his archive holdings. \\', \\'Weigand, born in 1954, learned the craft as a young longhair bearer in a Swiss hotel, which, in addition to the Yoga Centre of Beatles-Guru Maharishi, also housed a printing house. The experimental approach, which the artist practices with his mix of woodcut, etching or laser printing, may have been shaped by these years of teaching as well as by role models such as Sigmar Polke and Robert Rauschenberg. \\', \\'But Weigand\\\\\\'s art wool goes even further back, as the black-and-white hard rock painting \"666\" proves, which the 17-year-old friend of psychedelic drugs painted on his mom\\\\\\'s noodle board. This first work - by the way the only abstract picture of the show - hangs in the hall called \"Wunderkammer\" with rock music, where also Polaroids, wood sculptures, LPs and performances can be seen. A red thread through Weigand\\\\\\'s work is hard to see there. \\', \\'There is a variety of styles, as she celebrated Weigand\\\\\\'s selfie series \"Disco Boys\" in 1977: Sometimes he poses as a cool Macker in leather, sometimes as a Lebemann with a white suit, then again in Hacklerpanier. In the \"Wunderkammer\" Weigand still appears as a comprehensive collaborator of male colleagues such as Heimo Zobernig or Raymond Pettibon. In the rest of the show, the American fan rides alone on the wave, which can only really catch the viewer. \\', \\'For a series of architectural paintings, Weigand used black primed canvases and painted them with wide brushes in gold and silver. On this background, the artist printed sampled motifs of houses and collapsed bridges. \\', \\'A picture shows, for example, the horror house from Hitchcock\\\\\\'s film \"Psycho\", whose walls the artist composed of multiplied wooden elements borrowed from the crucifix of a copper engraving. A hidden statement about Christianity and necrophilic motherly love? Uncanny are also the mask figures of the Tyrolean customs, which are supposed to drive away the evil spirits in winter. The \"Klötzler\" from Absam is one of the pagan figures taken up by Weigand. He printed the clattering wooden pieces of the traditional costume with graphic motifs, so that in the performance \"Demon Brothers\" a dance movement emerges from fragmented images. \\', \\'Broken heroes from other worlds: Weigand finds them in the comic figure Silver Surfer, in the ancient messenger of the gods Hermes, in the apocalyptic sci-fi film \"Zardoz\" and even in the gorilla, which sits in the center of his \"panorama\". On wall wallpapers and on the mirrored floor, the installation offers views of a sea view with ruins on the coast. \\', \\'Weigand stages the beauty of a posthuman world in the right format. The gorilla is an allusion to the film \"Planet of the Monkeys\", where the waves of New York - with the exception of the Statue of Liberty - have faded. \\', \\'Weigand\\\\\\'s incantation of the American Dream also works in the lovingly decorated box, which reminds of the housing scales of the surfer culture. In this cabinet hangs, for example, a print stick, in which a guitar-playing surfer is carved, next to the woodcut of a surfboard. Here they come across, the \"good vibrations\" of which the Beach Boys have sung. \\', \\'On the other hand, the far too large oil hams, the xth wave in shell form or \"Joker\", on which a Harlequin trumpets. Here it is shown how easily one can make oneself a Kasperl in the medium of figurative painting. F\\']'],\n",

Can you find anything like truth here at all?\\', \\'Essence: The biggest challenge for journalism in the war is not front reports, but the explanation of the great contexts. The US media are not able to tell the big story. \\', \\'Why?\\', \\'Eat: First, the US government does not call this conflict \"war\" but \"Putin\\\\\\'s adventure policy\". The standards of so-called objectivity are so strict in some US media that the media cannot call war \"war\" even though they see war reigning there. The second problem is that the big man\\\\\\'s addiction is initially almost ridiculous and is not taken seriously by totalitarian politicians. Hannah Arendt already addressed how difficult it was for the American media at the beginning to tell the big story about Hitler and Stalin. \\', \\'What should the big story have been?\\', \\'Eat: Hitler and his followers are a threat to humanity because they believe that the Jews are to blame for everything. And Stalin and his people are dangerous because they believe that only the workers are to survive. That sounded so ridiculous that the story was not told. \\', \\'And what is the great Putin story?\\', \"Eat: Putin is not about protecting his strategic interests in Ukraine. The real big story is: Putin is waging war for traditional values. That sounds very ridiculous and stupid. And that he is waging a war to protect Ukraine from American homofascists sounds even more stupid. So journalists don\\'t even report about it. Instead, they write about what is happening on the ground. \", \\'We would like to show you a photo. It was taken during the Olympic Games in Sochi. See: Putin drinks schnapps with Austrian officials. What do you think when you see this photo?\\', \\'Eat: Austria has learned nothing. \\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\"Ernst Molden and Nino Mandl aka Der Nino aus Wien are an unequal couple. Molden, 47, looks like a daring big city cowboy, who can\\'t shake anything, while Mandl, 27, is like a big boy who eats too much unhealthy substances and could be blown off by the next wind blow. \", \\'What Molden and Mandl united: They are the outstanding Viennese songwriters of the present day. Live since 2011 also occasionally active in the duo, they now release their first joint record with \"Unser Österreich\". It contains twelve intimate cover versions of old Austropop songs and should increase their popularity even further. \\', \\'For the daily conversation at Pfefferminztee and Coca-Cola in Café Heumarkt, both appear battered: Ernst Molden went to the music store in the rain and came back sick, the Nino from Vienna had just to stop a tour because he caught the flu on a concert trip through Germany. Fever? \"I didn\\\\\\'t measure it, but felt 40 degrees,\" he says in a sleepy-nasal tone. Nicotine must still be, so the conversation in the middle of it is temporarily transferred to the smoking room. \\', \\'Falter: Would you like to hear a simple or difficult question first?\\', \\'Nino Mandl: A difficult one!\\', \\'Ernst Molden: I would have said the same. \\', \\'Well, Austropop, what is it?\\', \\'Mandl: Boah, i. e. (long, extensive coughing) Austropop was a music direction that existed from about 1970 to 1990 and in which all the participants finally did some really good things. \\', \\'Molden: For me, \"Austropop\" is not a term for music, but a media crutch for a sociological biotope. It is about the protagonists of Austrian music between 1970 and the mid-1990s, when Ö3 blocked this music. The word Austropop means a self-saturated group of artists. \\', \"You\\'re starting to save the musical honor of Austropop?\", \"Molden: We don\\'t want to save or rehabilitate Austropop, but we just sing songs that we worship, from artists we worship. Of course, this is partly the humus on which we have grown. The difference is that I have heard these songs in part, while the Nino can really perceive them as purely historical songs. \", \\'Mandl: I knew the big Austropop hits by my parents. I only discovered the pearls when I was told that I would sound like Heller or Ambros. Then I dealt with them more closely. \\', \\'Molden: The first songs I could play at the campfire were Austropop songs. The Nino was the ideal partner to record these songs completely reduced because he shares my dirty Austro passion. A bit like our project Bob Dylan\\\\\\'s Sinatra interpretations. Dylan says that he doesn\\\\\\'t covert these songs, but that he \"decovered them\". So he covers them and brings them out under the Sinatra myth. That\\\\\\'s what we do. \\', \\'Austropop means first line Ambros, Fendrich, Danzer & Co. Falco is also represented twice on \"Our Austria\". \\', \\'Molden: Falco comes from a different culture. In the meantime, Vienna was no longer influenced by 70s-gammers, but by the hot New Wave-Heinis. The language had changed, and he worked with this new language, but he is as much Vienna as the Ambros. Falco was groovier than the rest and with all seriousness also more and more party, therefore he has always worked differently. With music by Ambros or Danzer you can do everything in the range of self-sluffing until self-sluffing, at Falco something else is also possible. \\', \\'Mandl: Falco\\\\\\'s \"Night Flight\", the latest song on our album, can be reduced to the point where it sounds like a song by Ambros. \\', \\'Was the Austropop a purely Viennese phenomenon?\\', \\'Molden: In the end it was an urban music. The impudence to sing in the dialect about Sandler and the \"Hofa\" and then to become political could not have been lived in the Austrian country of the time around 1970. In addition, one had to be in Vienna, smoke in front of the Theseustempel and then shit on everything. The great pioneering achievement of Austrian dialect music was their courage. One either hated this music or one had to confess to it parareligiously, because it was the only island to rebel against the horrifying post-Nazi spies. \\', \\'Later \"Austropop\" became the\\', \\'Swear, young Austrian musicians have for a long time narrowed themselves sharply. You never scolded?\\', \\'Mandl: The last time I was asked in Switzerland what music I was making. I was still very sleepy and said \"Austriapop\". In fact, I am not terribly offended when someone says \"Austropop\", although I have always listened to English music. \\', \\'Molden: I deliberately made my first record in high German 20 years ago. I wanted to arrive at Heller\\\\\\'s art song rather than with the vulgar dialect singers. Sony\\\\\\'s record company powdered 300,000 shillings for the album, in order to have us recorded in the old studio of Wolfgang Ambros with the master craftsmen of the classic Austropop. Sony\\\\\\'s main marketing idea was: \"We take the record and go to Ö3. They will play it, and so it works. \" That was the main marketing idea of the Austrian record companies for 20 years already, and it was not quite wrong. But my debut was one of the first records, which fell under the order of the then Ö3 boss Bogdan Roscic, after which no German-speaking Austrian pop can be played any more. \\', \\'So no molds on Ö3. \\', \"Molden: Sony had no plan B. At the same time, the Viennese electronics exploded, and everyone heard Kruder &Dorfmeister. It was just clear that the times were changing. Before that, it was paradisiacal for Austrian musicians: you were played on Ö3, so you got enormous radio bonuses, and you made a lot of money through CD sales. Today, as a musician, there is only one thing left for you: to play concerts diligently. My generation of musicians was socialized under difficult conditions, and then you don\\'t just stay hungry in the word sense. \", \\'Mandl: I had a slightly easier start. When my first album came out in 2008, bands like Yes, Panic had just started something new. Unlike in the 90s, this kind of music was positively recorded, and there was a wave that continues to this day. I imagine the time when the electronics were ruling in Vienna much more difficult. \\', \\'Molden: At the beginning ten, 20 people came to my concerts. I actually played my audience from gig to performance. There was a bigger change in the late zeros. Young bands and artists with German lyrics appeared, at the same time something happened with the Viennese song, which is a bit of a sister channel of the Austropopkanal. Musically traditional and local, but also Viennese and in an anti-art homeland. Suddenly I was no longer alone. \\', \\'However, for a long time you have sung High German. \\', \\'Molden: I came to the dialect only at the suggestion of Willi Resetarits. He was always a light figure for me, because he was the only one who never became embarrassed, from the butterflies over the Ostbahn-Kurti to the late things. \\', \\'Mandl: At first I only wrote High German. From a fun project, where I wanted to sing spontaneously in the dialect and use as many scolding words as possible, the song \"Du Oasch\" came out. Unlike me, my band thought it was great, and that\\\\\\'s exactly what people liked better than anything I thought about cleanly. But High German is still better for me today. I write in the dialect, it always gets funny. \\', \\'Molden: Funny is one danger, the nativeness the other. Today one no longer has to distance oneself from the ambros, but from the home industry à la Gabalier. \\', \\'Why do you have to distance yourself?\\', \\'Molden: Stricterly said: The Gabalian is the answer to Islamism. Both are currents that respond to globalization. Religious fundamentalism on the one hand, and Central European fundamentalism on the other. To me both are equally unsympathetic. \\', \"But Gabalian does less harm than Islamism, doesn\\'t he?\", \\'Molden: Of course, the home wave does not do any harm in the first place, but where does it lead? Pegida and the dialect hitters are related symptoms of our time. One wants home, one wants belonging, and one defines this via exclusion. These characteristics apply to Islamism as well as to Alpine customs. And neither is necessary, because there is enough room in the world for every little animal and every little place. \\', \\'Mandl: You go to a Gabalian concert in order to be among his peers, you uniform yourself in a certain way. How repulsive. His announcements are also a madness: \"Mia san dahoam! Show me your leather pants and your maidens, listen to this, so it shall be!\"\\', \"Molden: The guy, who sings a song in Viennese, will have respect for someone from Mali, who sings a Malian song, or a punk from London, who sings a London punk song. And he doesn\\'t want to have anything but his own, because that\\'s exactly the wrong thing! The more local you express yourself, the more you affirm the diversity of this world, if you make it honest. You want globalization. Of course not in the Coca-Cola version, but as a big, happy, partly sunny, partly shady flower meadow. I\\'m also afraid of Servus TV, the central organ of the new homeliness, which works through belonging and demarcation. Vienna is a 200-year-old globalized concept, it\\'s the opposite of naughtyness and rotten homeliness!\", \\'Does Gabalian have something fascist, as is claimed in some places?\\', \\'Molden: His kind of authoritarian entertainment awakens at least unsightly memories. It\\\\\\'s also scary what an icyly crafted marketing concept is behind the \"Volks-Rock-\\\\\\'n\\\\\\'-Roll\" brand. Anyone who thinks through this as closely as Gabalier and his team, does not happen to use the word \"people\". Anyone who went to school in Austria in the Kreisky and Post-Kreisky years should know what all this word connotates. If as an intelligent person - and I think Gabalier is intelligent - \"people\" is the basis for a conscious decision. \\', \\'Success is right for him. \\', \\'Molden: There was a great longing, which is served and instrumentalized by him. There is an enormous variety of good Austrian music, which could possibly heal these people again from Gabalian. The question is only how to achieve it. \\', \\'By the much-discussed mandatory radio quota for Austrian music possibly?\\', \"Molden: I don\\'t want to be played on Ö3 or Radio Wien anymore, because these are such broken and corrupt vehicles. It would only hurt our music. I don\\'t want a quota either, because media should never be prescribed for what they play, write or do. The cultural offer is there, the material is there, but the distribution mechanisms are missing. It would need media that doesn\\'t work with shortages, but reproduce and propagate diversity. I would like, for example, that an independent radio is founded in Vienna once again. \", \\'Like Andreas Gabalier, the classical Austropop likes to assume provinciality. \\', \\'Molden: I don\\\\\\'t think so. The songs we worship convey a sense of the city. And even though \"Our Austria\" sounds almost like Alternative Country, Nino and I also make urban music, which, despite its reduction on two guitars and two voices between stone walls, arises alongside car noise in one of many lamps lit night. That\\\\\\'s nothing that sounds like on the alpine pasture. My problem with the classic Austropop was always more of a musical preparation. The song can be great, but once this certain Häusl keyboard appears, I can\\\\\\'t listen to it anymore. At some point this scene believed that it had found the formula for success. It was no longer a departure from that. The essence of this formula was to create a feel-good zone without breaking and emptying. \\', \\'Mandl: Ambros solo, only with the acoustic guitar, has a completely different energy than on record with all the overloaded arrangements. \\', \\'Molden: The voice is still there, as a singer Ambros creates goose bumps to this day. I hope that somewhere a Rick Rubin waits for Ambros, who just presses his guitar into his hand and presses for recording. Whether he plays the guitar well or not, is a whirlwind, that was also a whirlwind with Johnny Cash. \\', \\'What broke the Austropop?\\', \\'Mandl: The commerce and the alcohol, I think. \\', \\'Molden: And the impermeability. For a few years, there was a blissful, mutually fertilizing scene, but then she began to look jealously and shut down the hatches. There was no communication between the generations, as it is common today in Vienna, but it was a parvenu society that wanted to cement itself. The prize for this was artistic integrity. \\', \"Mandl: They just got older, too. Of course, you can\\'t find anything that the Austropop of the late 80s produced. But I\\'m curious about how my generation will fare. Will we be able to do something cool later on? I think that when you\\'re old, you break down if you don\\'t pay attention. To be honest, I\\'m afraid of it myself a little bit. \", \"Molden: I don\\'t. And do you know why? Because I have you! People who are 20 years younger, let me sit there until I get tired at half an hour at night and allow me to look at their world. And at the same time, people like Willi Resetarits and Sigi Maron exist who pass on their art in my direction. The classic outtroopers had the problem that they only took themselves as a reference. Maybe an encounter with the punk would have done the Ambros super good. To close their eyes is the artistic death. \", \\'At present, all of Germany is captivated by the pop city of Vienna. Are picture books and Wanda the \"new Austropop\", as is often said?\\', \\'Mandl: In Mainz it is said that the boys are talking Viennese at parties in order to impress the girls. So Viennese is currently so popular that a fake Viennese accent increases the chances of cracking up. \\', \\'Molden: Now that the term \"Austropop 2. 0\" is being used again, shows that the word is above all a journalistic production. There is a gap in the local pop, namely the time of the Viennese electronics of the 90s. Whether you liked this phase at that time or not, Viennese pop was never more internationally regarded than at that time. In the end, Kruder & Dorfmeister is no different today than the Ambros of the zero years. They make a lot of money by producing advertising, but they have long given up their artistic pioneering role. \\', \\'But Kruder & Dorfmeister have never become an embarrassment. \\', \"Molden: Yes, but they didn\\'t get fertilized as much as the old Austropopper 20 years before. And they also have their regular clients. But that\\'s just not the beer tent, but the big advertising agency. Now something new is happening in Vienna. \", \\'So the bands Wanda and picture book?\\', \\'Molden: Above all, I feel Wanda as a real healer. They transport an absolutely right Viennese feeling of life, in which one does not cut up the wrists, but wants to drink five Underberg and spend a fun evening. Wanda shows that one can also produce invigorating and aphrodisiac distillates from the Viennese soup. I also enjoy picture books the success, only I can start with them less artistically. \\', \"Mandl: Wanda is conquering everything in the storm. Quite rightly. When does it happen that a band with such a commercial potential is so good? Image book is too encrypted for me, I can\\'t quite recognize the songs. Maybe you would have to reduce them to the acoustic guitar in a few years? In the current form, this is more of a carnival for me: colorful and a bit confused. \", \\'But isn\\\\\\'t picture book \"Schick Schock\" the best Falco album since \"Young Romans\"?\\', \\'Molden: From the components, yes, but Falco\\\\\\'s \"shit on\" gesture goes away. Picture book have Falco\\\\\\'s rhythmic style and his rhythmic phrasing, but they lack his basic attitude. That\\\\\\'s why it becomes a kit. I can only agree with Wanda: \"If someone asks what you stand for, say for Amore!\"\\', \\'From \"Amore\" to \"Futkarli\", which is sung in Georg Danzer\\\\\\'s song \"Vorstadtcasanova\". How do you explain to the non-Vienna what this is?\\', \\'Molden: My wife has forbidden me to play such an ordinary song in the presence of the Advent wreath, and my son Karl indignantly asked at the \"Vorstadtcasanova\" what he and Fut have to do with each other. But the Futkarli is simply the womanizer of the Viennese suburb. The crowd contributes to his nimbus, i. e. the number of climbed Futna, as they say in Viennese. \\', \\'Ambros or Danzer?\\', \"Mandl: Ambros, because he\\'s getting closer to me. \", \\'Molden: As songwriter Danzer, as interpreter Ambros. \\', \\'Mandl: If there is \"Our Austria Volume 2\", I would also like to have Rainhard Fendrich on it. \\', \"Molden: But I\\'m not that far yet!\", \"Mandl: I always thought he was one of the gravediggers of Austropop. But Wanda\\'s guitarist is a big fendrich fan, and he played all the records for me in long sessions. Fendrich made some really good songs, compared to the others but also a lot of garbage. His yield is not so great overall, but if the serious doesn\\'t refuse, we could take the good ones with us. \", \\'Molden: I still have to deal with this. Maybe a fendrich listening session led by Wanda will help?\\', \\'Mr. Mandl, what do you value about Ernst Molden?\\', \\'Mandl: He is a great guitarist, I sometimes wish I could play so well. But then I reject the idea again and am glad that I have a guitar at all. He is a great songwriter with really many songs that stay in your heart and mind for a long time. It is also very pleasant and relaxed to play with him. And I also like to read what he writes. \\', \\'And vice versa?\\', \\'Molden: I can only say about Nino: It is quite rare that you meet a genius, next to which you feel so fundamentally comfortable. \\', \"Mandl: I\\'m not a genius!\", \"Molden: I think I do, and I\\'ve also accumulated a long list of evidence for it, but you\\'ll only see it later. \", \\'To the plate\\', \\'\"Unser Österreich\" (Monkey) contains twelve Austropop cover versions, reduced to two voices and two guitars. Fad? Not a bit. In intimate arrangements, the Nino from Vienna and Ernst Molden Georg Danzer, Wolfgang Ambros, Falco, Ludwig Hirsch, Sigi Maron, André Heller and Heller/Qualtinger do not just play, but they make themselves the knowledgeably selected songs in radically unsettled and partly completely new versions respectfully, but fearlessly own and create the piece of art from which heterogeneous starting material makes an immensely harmonious album. Predicate valuable? No, predicate superleiwand!\\', \\'The person\\', \\'Nino Mandl alias Der Nino aus Wien, born 1987, is a Viennese songwriter, who became known by the YouTube hit \"Du Oasch\" at the end of the 2000s and is known as \"André Heller der Generation FM4\".

       "array(['[\\'Where are the women more beautiful and the festivals wilder, in Damascus or in Beirut? The boys at Vienna\\\\\\'s Westbahnhof are not quite in agreement. In the end, the Syrian capital wins. \"After Beirut, we are only if we wanted a little change,\" says Eyad. At home, the 21-year-old had his own mobile phone shop. Pictures of this are still on his Facebook page, you only have to scroll down far enough. \\', \\'\"We had fun, we had work, family, just a good life,\" says Abdulhamid. Until the war came. Now they spend the warm days on the Danube Island or go after the German course to the Westbahnhof and help newly arrived refugees. \"Last week I pulled an Afghan who could not swim out of the water on the Danube Island,\" says Emad, who worked in Syria next to his studies as a swimming instructor. He wished it had been an Austrian that he saved, the boy jokes: \"Then I would have become famous and stood in the newspaper!\"\\', \\'The young men are six out of many thousands who flee the war in Syria to Austria. 15,000 people came to Austria on their own last Monday across the Hungarian border. Most of them want to move on to Germany, Sweden or Norway. Many will stay here. Because Germany and other states close their borders. Or they stayed because they were caught by Austrian police officers. \\', \\'Hasan, for example. When he was travelling with the tug in March 2014, he got into police control and had to file his asylum application in Austria. Germany would have been his destination. From Austria he only knew what Asmahan once sang. \"Here is no less than paradise. Vienna is the Garden of Eden, a moment of bliss\", is a song line of the famous Syrian black and white film \"Love and Revenge\", shot in 1944, when bombs fell on Vienna, as today on Damascus. What the Americans of the \"Sound of Music\", the history of the Trapp family, is to the Syrians this old snout about Vienna, the Garden of Eden of the World. \\', \\'Hasan now has his own garden Eden in Vienna. A rather modest one, in Simmering, right next to the east highway. Hasan lives with his family in Macondo, a refugee settlement in the 11th district, just behind the big garbage site of the MA 48, where the city almost stops. He cleared the rubble in front of the house and laid out a small vegetable bed there, with zucchini, potatoes, peppers and Paradeisers. In Damascus he worked as a cook. He proudly shows pictures of the barbecues he has prepared on his mobile phone. \\', \\'In Austria, he is one of the many Syrian refugees who are causing the labour market service to break its head. The raw data on the new Viennese people from Syria are disastrous. Almost a third of them are unable to provide completed school education, about 40 percent are only compulsory school graduates, the academic rate is eight percent. \"But that\\\\\\'s a bit of a reputation killing on these people,\" says the spokesman of the AMS Vienna, \"because we notice that the Syrians are more qualified than it says in our data. \" A vocational training must be proven with a certificate, \"and what should our poor AMS supervisor enter if she gets an Arabic certificate that she cannot read?\", he adds. Or someone like Hasan, who is a cook, but cannot provide an official document. Anyone who has to flee does not always take all the papers with him. Therefore, the AMS now has its own \"competence check\" for Syrians. However, exact results can only be expected in December. \\', \\'In Syria there was a six-year schooling obligation under the old ruler Hafiz al-Assad; when his son Bashar al-Assad took power in 2000, it was extended to nine years. The socialist Baath party, which has ruled the country for many decades and oriented towards the Soviet Union, focused on education in Syria, where about forty percent of the inhabitants were illiterate in the 1980s. \\', \\'Manal Hubmann, who came to Austria from Syria in 2000, can still remember that. \"There were men in our village and told our mothers that they could learn to read and write while we were children in school. \" At that time, her home was a rich country, she says. The health system was free for all people, \"because Lebanese came to us to have their surgery. \"\\', \\'Today, starving Syrian children are begging for food on the streets of the Lebanese capital Beirut. More than a million Syrian refugees are already living in the neighbouring state. Because Lebanon has closed the border with Syria, a large number of refugees who now come to Austria via Hungary have fled here directly from Syria. Many have tried to find protection elsewhere in their own country. Almost eight million Syrians are fleeing within Syria. Hasan, the cook from Damascus, has not gone straight to Europe. \"When we were unable to live in Damascus because of the bombs, we moved to my parents in Kamishli in the north,\" he says. There he and his wife tried to earn some money with a mini-market to live. \"But because the IS had encircled the region, I could only refer from Turkey and Iraq goods,\" says Hasan. The imported goods had been so expensive that hardly anyone could afford to buy them. When they had no water, no electricity and no heating, and the IS approached, the Syrian Kurmunde gave up the meeting place of call for refugees and now the Syrian Kurmunde has become part of the West. \\', \\'\"Arabic\" or \"Kurdi\" is written on the notes that the helpers put on their sweaters. Syria was a multicultural nation, of the Aramaic people who still speak the language of Jesus today, about Assyrians, Kurds, Armenians, Druzes, Christians, Muslims; hardly any country has so many cultures and religions united. \"In my home town there were five different languages, seven ethnic groups and five religions,\" says the Syrian musician Salah Ammo, who comes from the region near the Turkish border, \"all lived together peacefully. \" Although Muslims had not married Christians and vice versa, \"but they liked to celebrate together\". \\', \\'Just as women were involved in social life. \"When I studied at the end of the 1980s, forty percent of medical students were female,\" says Syrian physician Mazen Zeino, who worked until recently in Linz, \"there were even more women in subjects such as pharmacy, architecture or languages. \" And the musician Ammo adds that Syrian women have not only dressed like European women, \"but actually also more sexy than here in Austria. \" From fully veiled to mini rock, everything has happened on the streets of Damascus. \\', \\'This pluralism was felt in social life at the time, says sociologist Rojin Ali, who is married to the musician Ammo and has been living in Austria since 2013. \"In particular, there was everything in Damascus, from ultraconservative to completely free. \" However, this freedom had its limitations. Not only through the ubiquitous secret service, which suppressed the opposition. Indoctrination began already in school. \"When I went to school, we had our own subject in which we learned to march and salute militarily,\" says Ali. Moreover, every Syrian adolescent learns in his own school subject why the ruling Baath party is the best and Israel the enemy. Nevertheless, the three years before the war had been the best, Ali says. \"It was such a good mood in the country. There was a lively social life and there were so many students as never before. \"\\', \\'But with the beginning of the war in 2011, Syrian society had been divided, Ali says, in Syria as well as in the Diaspora. \"You are either for Assad or against him. There is no neutrality. \" This gap draws from the top of society to every single family: \"I know a brother and brother, they are now enemies, because one is pro Assad and the other against him. \"\\', \\'And everyone wants to recruit fighters. The boys from Westbahnhof had to know that in their own right. \"On all fronts they want the young men for the war,\" says Eyad, \"the regime, the jihadist God warriors, the free Syrian army. And all sides say: \\\\\\'If you don\\\\\\'t fight with us, then you\\\\\\'re our enemy\\\\\\'. \" In this chaos of hostile warriors, additionally criminal gangs have emerged that extort ransom with kidnappings. \\', \\'It was their parents who sent them off, the young men tell. \"They didn\\\\\\'t want us to be killed or have to kill,\" says Abdulhamid. Now the six-year-olds are sitting in a 60-square-meter apartment. Five of them have studied business administration, tourism management, computer science. One of them wants to complete his studies here. Currently they are attending the German course. But here, too, there is a bureaucratic hurdle: those who want to learn German from the Integration Fund must have a \"Convention Travel Pass\" for refugees. This costs 75 euros. Money that many refugees do not have. \\', \\'\"We pay 850 euros for 60 square meters,\" says Eyad. For how hard it is for refugees on the housing market, this is cheap. \"I know Syrians who live in an apartment at seventeen and everyone has to pay 250 euros per month for a mattress. \"\\', \\'They miss most of their families in Syria. \"We don\\\\\\'t have a chance to bring our parents or our little siblings to safety,\" says one of them. Because there\\\\\\'s no official route and they wouldn\\\\\\'t trust their families to a tug. \"A woman died in the bus that smuggled me across the border,\" says one of the boys, \"the tug put the gun on our temples to take off our phones,\" says another. \\', \\'Helping the family in Syria, learning German, finding a job. These are the wishes of many young refugees who have found a new home in Vienna. If you ask them about their dreams, there are very modest answers. \"I want to finish my studies here,\" says Mohammed. \"I have trained Taekwondo in Syria for eight years, my biggest dream would be to be able to train again in Vienna,\" says Yasser. \"And I want a girlfriend,\" jokes Eyad. \"You Depp, what do you do with a friend? You don\\\\\\'t have an apartment!\" his friend calls. Later Eyad says that he would like to stay with an Austrian family. \"I would pay for my own room too,\" he says. \\', \\'The musician Salah Ammo has already found his \"normal\" life after the flight. Only last week he performed with other Syrian musicians at the Porgy &Bess in Vienna. His wife Rojin Ali works for the Caritas and the International Organisation for Migration, regularly travels to Lebanon to prepare Syrians, who are flown directly to the country by Austria as part of a humanitarian quota. \"They always ask whether they don\\\\\\'t have to go to Traiskirchen anyway,\" she says. The pictures of homeless refugees in the Austrian refugee camp have penetrated all the way to Beirut. \\', \\'Hasan is not so easy. Although he goes to the German course every day for three hours, the head is full of worries. Wife Yasmin is pregnant and the 70-square-meter apartment in Macondo has no heating. 500 euros rent the Syrians of the federal real estate company pay for it. To heat with electricity, he can not afford. \"How should the baby live in a cold apartment?\" he asks. \"How should I find a new apartment? With so many problems I think my head will be broken soon\". \\', \\'Syria\\', \"The territory of today\\'s Syria has been inhabited since at least 10,000 BC, the capital Damascus is the longest continuously inhabited city in the world. With 185,000 square kilometres, Syria is more than twice as large as Austria. In 1946 the former French protectorate became independent, since 1970 it is governed by the Assad family. By 2000 Hafiz al-Assad was in power, after his death his son Bashar al-Assad took over. After peaceful protests, Syria slid into a civil war in 2011 with nearly 250,000 deaths. Of the 22 million inhabitants, eight million are fleeing in the country, five million have had to flee abroad. Between January and July 2015, 10,000 Syrians have sought asylum in Austria. \", \\'Focus on escape\\', \\'PAGE 6\\', \\'Comment Open borders need open words\\', \\'PAGE 10\\', \\'Hello Syrians!

       "array(['[\"Does the city finance kindergartens from radical Islamic associations? Yes, says the Islamic scholar Ednan Aslan from the Institute for Islamic Studies of the University of Vienna. Last week, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) published an interim study of Aslan, which was then massively attacked by colleagues and representatives of the faith community (see page 6). In an interview, Aslan explains his motives and criticizes the city, the SPÖ, the Muslim community and the operators of some children\\'s groups. \", \"Falter: Professor Aslan, you have prepared an interim report on children\\'s groups and warn against the emergence of a parallel structure. Some of your colleagues criticize your study as unscientific. \", \\'Ednan Aslan: My critics cannot know my work yet, because we are in the middle of it, the report is just an interim report. What is it about? We have been creating the Islamic map for a few years, where we map Muslim institutions. We also wanted to document the Islamic kindergartens there. Thus, last year, we started to look out for all those associations that offer Islamic childcare. We once got a club register extract for every association that advertises with the word \"Islamic\" or \"Multiculti\" and saw who runs the association. Then we didn\\\\\\'t get out of the wonder. \\', \\'Why?\\', \\'Aslan: Because we analyzed the background of some officials from the association registers. And then we realized that there are very radical people doing their business with the children. This ranges from Sudanese and Chechen organizations to the associations of Millî Görüş. They offer an education that no longer corresponds to the quality standards that the city should promote. \\', \\'Do you have evidence of these claims?\\', \\'Aslan: (Get a folder with the club register extracts and browse through them. ) Here, for example, they have an association that is particularly extreme, an Islamist organization. Or here, from this club functionary, I can show them a few YouTube videos later, where you will be amazed. We would like to take a closer look at all this. But the SPÖ, especially the municipal councillor Omar Al-Rawi, wanted to prevent this from happening before the election. \\', \\'Why is that?\\', \"Aslan: These Islamic kindergartens are actively politically marketed by the city in the mosque communities. Nobody wanted to look more closely. The first conversation with the city was in July 2014. I had brought the idea for a study to the city at the time, also the children\\'s and youth attorney\\'s office was involved. I said there are cases, we have to do something. First it was: OK! Then the cooperation was completely cancelled. \", \"So you\\'re accusing me that the city of Vienna has turned the study on you, even under pressure from Muslim MPs. \", \\'Aslan: Yes, it seems so. And because the accusation came that I would stuff my pockets: I earn only 600 euros from the study that the Foreign Office is paying, of the 30,000 euros. The rest goes to the university. \\', \\'Your critics claim that you would now sound the alarm, but upon request do not call the affected kindergartens. \\', \"Aslan: I\\'m talking about the structures, about the support system, not about the pillory. But I\\'ve dealt with the university ethics council, because some parents reported to us in the confidential interviews that children are supposed to be beaten too. Here, for example, read this interview (takes a transcript of a conversation). Here, a mother tells us that they are beaten in a kindergarten. And here, parents who forbid their children to go out. Or here, listen to this (Aslan opens an audio file with the interview with an Egyptian kindergarten supervisor). This lady is teaching language! And this is subsidized by the city? That\\'s not how it can be done!\", \\'How does religious education take place?\\', \\'Aslan: I looked at the speeches of a kindergarten manager who was visited a few years ago by Pierre Vogel, a well-known German Salafist. He rejects the way of life in the West in his speeches, emphasizes the leadership role of Muslims and calls for his own Muslim environment for Muslim children to protect them from the harmful influences of the majority society. It is about an Islamic environmental claim, that is a certain radicalism. And from there it is not very far in extremism and in the Islamic state. \\', \\'Parents in an open society have the right to raise their child in a religious environment. \\', \"Aslan: You\\'re right. I\\'m not talking about religious education either. On the contrary, I\\'m a religious pedagogue myself. Religious education can strengthen tolerance. It becomes problematic when they learn to condemn other believers. They can refuse alcohol or miniskirts, but they shouldn\\'t despise those who drink alcohol or wear miniskirts. \", \\'You claim that contempt is taught in kindergartens?\\', \\'Aslan: No, I wouldn\\\\\\'t go that far. But look at the teaching materials of the Viennese Islamic Institute, which trains supervisors. Sharia is praised here in detail. Here, read the chapter on polygamy: It says that she is \"inescapable\" because the men have to live out their sexuality. \\', \\'However, the Islamic community is not in favour of the introduction of Sharia. \\', \\'Aslan: The IGGiÖ says: We are the minority here, therefore the Sharia does not apply. But what does this mean if they were to represent the majority? Are the women stoned after all? I am not only concerned, as you notice, with the kindergartens, but with the fire of the Enlightenment, through which we Muslims finally have to go through - not only in raising children!\\', \\'Who is interested in the fact that it does not blaze? Many modern Muslims live in Vienna. \\', \\'Aslan: There are many different interests, including economic ones. One reason why we are frozen is that almost all mosque communities are controlled by foreign countries. There are no independent Muslim structures in this city. Many Muslims see freedom as a danger. And to counter these dangers, they are looking for protection zones, kindergartens, for example. \\', \\'One could teach a tolerant Islam there. \\', \"Aslan: Yes, you\\'re right, that\\'s the chance of religious education. The children could perceive plurality in a religious education and get to know other religions, that would be a task for Islamic kindergartens. But in the Islamic kindergartens that we have, they often don\\'t get to know new lifestyles. \", \\'Do you have proof of that?\\', \\'Aslan: We have statements from the parents. And now that I\\\\\\'m starting to research, I\\\\\\'m getting more and more clues. Or look at this video. Now you\\\\\\'re looking at a man who wants to sue me because I\\\\\\'m moving him close to the Muslim Brotherhood. Watch the video! It\\\\\\'s called \"The Billing Day Comes,\" they hear machine gun salves as a signation. And then he introduces himself as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. \\', \\'Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz calls for the closure of kindergartens. \\', \"Aslan: I think that\\'s wrong. Many sponsored associations see the city only as a bank and a controller. But the city has to do more. It should advise, educate, accompany the clubs. Closing kindergartens doesn\\'t solve the problem. Vienna, for example, banned an Egyptian school - and what does the operator do? He makes it kindergartens!\", \\'Islamic activists are now attacking you very hard. Their demands are inhumane, you are not a scientist at all, you were deposed. \\', \\'Aslan: Yes, I know that. My assistant Mouhanad Khorchide was also accused of doing so when he examined the world view of the Islam teachers. The faith community believes that I must run the Institute of Islamic Studies like a Koranic school. But this is a university! We must finally deal with our writings radically differently. ISIS shows us these days what is written in our books. The fact that homosexuals are thrown away from the high-rise building is theologically well-founded there. Just as people are being brainwashed, drowned or burned. \\', \\'Does this have anything to do with Islam?\\', \"Aslan: It\\'s in our books. Therefore, we must finally cleanse Islam of this dirt! We need a new prophet image: because burning, crucifixing and chopping off the head, it\\'s in the writings, damn it! The Prophet must be freed from this theology of violence. \", \\'Your colleagues will accuse you of Islamophobia?\\', \\'Aslan: The Islamophobia accusation is only anti-Western resentment in a new guise. The AKP of Turkish President Erdoğan organized at least five Islamophobia conferences last year, and this is only about the old settlement with the supposedly so corrupt West. Of course there is racism here, but that one calls the criticism of the conditions Islamophobia only strengthens the sacrificial role of Muslims, who today live as well in Europe as nowhere else. No, this is not an honest debate!\\', \"You\\'re denying Muslims to be victims too?\", \"Aslan: Of course, there are resentments here. But the fear is also understandable. Who kills in Paris, Syria and Afghanistan? How do the Taliban justify their violence? What do the children who become terrorists believe? We Muslims are raised by force! Look at women\\'s houses, almost only Muslimas sit there. 35 percent Muslims sit in the detention centres! People, please wake up! The violence is glorified. When a boy is born in Turkey, the penis is kissed, for their daughters they are still ashamed. \", \\'Mr. Aslan, are you afraid?\\', \\'Aslan: Yes, sometimes. And many others too. Recently, the Institute was prayed and called \"Allahu akbar!\" People believed that a bomb was about to explode. So far we are. We have made Islam a religion of fear. That has nothing to do with God and the Prophet!\\', \\'What does Islam mean to you?\\', \\'Aslan: I was educated with punishing images of God. Distances began with study in Europe. I saw people think differently in freedom. I can remember how a college student hugged me from behind and I felt her bosom. I thought, man, what a beautiful feeling! But I denied my feelings. I couldn\\\\\\'t feel well, at least I believed that. I freed myself from this compulsion. Today I know: I can look at a woman, I can enjoy, laugh with him, dance with him. I say to God: \"You have done a lot to me and now you take a lot back!\" I can communicate with God without theological compulsion and have come closer to him. \\', \\'Do you get death threats?\\', \\'Aslan: I get subtle hints that I should be \"neutralized\". But I don\\\\\\'t take this seriously. I always ask to kill myself in ten years, then I can continue to research and hope that Islam will be modernized. \\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\\'The small photo on the website of the Institute of Contemporary History shows him sunk in himself, with an averted look. The distinctive head comes to the fore, Francis Bacon would have loved to paint him. Probably there are good reasons to consider melancholy for the adequate disposition of every historian. But as melancholic I never felt Siegi Mattl - I think no one has ever said \"Siegfried\" to him. \\', \\'The images of memory, which now, since one still doesn\\\\\\'t like to grasp them, are quite different: his lively facial expressions, especially his tooth-rich laughter. Even until the (predictably) last days, when his closest friends - there were not a few - visited him in the AKH, much had been laughed at: \"When you closed your eyes, it was still the old Siegi,\" says Peter Pilz, Green politician and best friend since Mürztaler Jugendtage. \\', \\'Together, they decide to go to Vienna to study and join a radical leftist organization. When Pilz arrives in the Federal Capital with some delay, Mattl opens up to him: \"Peter, we are at VSStÖ. \" The two buddies watch the carnation revolution in Portugal, drive as harvest helpers and construction workers to Cuba and strike successfully for the right to beer during the lunch break. The political guest game in the Association of Socialist Students, in which comrades such as Michael Häupl, Josef Cap or Renate Brauner set the tone, ends in 1977 with a throw-out, because the two of them do not want to be banned from participating in antifa demos, just because communists also march along. Pilz: \"The SPÖ was only about making use of exuberant useful talents. Because we definitely did not want to pursue a party career, we refused to become useful. \"\\', \\'Also in the next political port, the Trotskyist GRM (Group of Revolutionary Marxists, later: SOAL, Socialist Alternative), the two of them will be treated for stubborn lack of prowess. On the serious question of their \"tarn names\" they insist on \"Peter\" and \"Siegi\", \"certainly the most clever camouflage of the whole Fourth International\", as Pilz is still convinced today. Such insidiousness is balanced by the ambitious effort to make the organ of the Red Front \"a funny legible newspaper\", which also succeeds with the left under the direction of editor-in-chief Raimund Löw. \\', \\'As a historian, publicist and curator, Mattl, who habilitates himself in 1995 and takes over the leadership of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Society and History in 2005, remains an unorthodox head. He tackles the wide field of cultural and media sciences without clapping coquettishly on all the keyboards of interdisciplinarity. When it comes to setting up funding funds, he has high strategic intelligence, the network of his contacts spans continents. It is not important to him to use all this for his own career. He was always willing to allow others to benefit from his great knowledge and alert intelligence without all the gloom. \\', \\'\"He has advised incredibly many people, but never paid attention to the fact that in the end his copyright is on it,\" says philosopher and historian Ingo Zechner, curator of the show \"Images of Liberation\" (3 to 7 May in the Film Museum), in which Mattl was also involved. As a representative of the \"Visual History\", whose attention was most recently focused on \"ephemeral film\" (amateur and industrial films, weekly shows, etc. ), he became an important source of inspiration: \"His clues and knowledge have opened up new dimensions of how to think film, yes, must think,\" explains film museum director Alexander Horwath, who soon after his appointment in 2002 as a dialog partner, co-worker and thinker. \\', \\'I myself met Siegi in the second half of the 1980s. The future workshop of the SPÖ organized symposia in the museum of the working world, we helped with the organization. I remember keywords such as \"postfordism\", \"lifetime models\", \"cultural society\". I do not suppose that Siegi was connected to the head of the future workshop, Josef Cap, from common VSStÖ times in excessive sympathy. He was, of course, among the rare people who are sovereign enough to be able to dispense with the care of their own constraints. To the SPÖ as a political party, especially as a power apparatus, he had a dissociated relationship. But it would never have occurred to him that (together with Helene Maimann) he had designed exhibitions as important as \"with us the new time\" (1981) or \"The cold of February\" (1984) to discuss the historical performance of the Social Democracy. \\', \\'Siegi was the last one who would have taken a perverse pleasure in keeping right or always knew it. What impressed me beside his noblesse and his kindness was his elegance. In the 80s an Austrian intellectual who could get dressed was still a real exception (since then it has become a bit, but not much better). \\', \\'Maybe his love for the music of the Sixties also has a little to do with the style consciousness of the mods. If I could put something on him to say goodbye, it would be \"This Time Tomorrow\" from the Kinks. \"I\\\\\\'ll leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by /Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain\\\\\\'t so big at all. \"\\', \\'Without Siegi Mattl, the world has become even smaller. \\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\\'Eric Pleskow must have always been an extraordinary phenomenon among the hard-pressed businessmen of the US film industry. A very cultivated and humorous man, politically liberal and professionally extremely successful. \"We were a bit different,\" says the Viennese-born, laughing when he talks about the Hollywood of his time and the United Artists leadership days, where he worked his way up to the president. \\', \\'In 1978, Plesskov and his colleagues founded the production company Orion Pictures, which triumphed four times in the royal discipline at the Oscars within a few years: \"Amadeus\" (1985), \"Platoon\" (1987), \"Dances With Wolves\" (1990) and \"Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). \\', \"On the occasion of the weekend\\'s Oscar night, the waltz asked the 90-year-old Hollywood tycoon to talk about what has changed since then and how he experiences the whole hustle and bustle today. We reached Eric Pleskow, the honorary president of the Viennale and since 2007 also honorary citizen of the city of Vienna, in New York. \", \\'Falter: Mr. Pleskow, are you watching the Oscar gala on TV?\\', \\'Eric Pleskow: Of course, like every ordinary citizen. I retired years ago. The last time I had a movie with the Oscars was \"The Silence of the Lambs\". \\', \\'But you are still a member of the American Film Academy?\\', \\'Plevskov: I am one of 6000 members, yes. We get the movies on DVD for viewing and then give our voice to the Oscars. \\', \\'Is that right for your own movies?\\', \\'Plevskov: Of course, you vote on all the films. It was all the more surprising that we won so often. We never had our own studios and no technical staff and therefore much less votes at the Academy, because normally the employees vote for the films of their studio. \\', \\'Can you say something to your favorites as a member?\\', \"Plesskov: I\\'d rather not. They ask you every year not to reveal what you choose. But what I can say, on the whole: that all the special effects stories aren\\'t my case. I\\'ve always been interested in the Conditio humana. There are fewer films now. Taste has changed a lot, and I don\\'t know if I could be there if I were still active today. \", \\'Not only the taste, but also the politics have changed - when you see the heroic \"American Sniper\" and think of the films you have produced about Vietnam!\\', \\'Plesskov: This is another world. Back then, in \"Coming Home\" or \"Apocalypse Now\", the heroes were already completely broken. \\', \\'\"Boyhood\" is this year a film that is truly unique in its own way. \\', \\'Plessvkow: I find Richard Linklater a highly interesting director. I don\\\\\\'t know him personally, but he did film at least once in Vienna. Accompanying the characters over such a long period of time as \"Boyhood\" was a good, completely new idea. \\', \"It\\'s said there\\'s 14 Oscars on your mantel. \", \"Plesskov: I\\'ve had five since I sold my house and moved in an apartment. The rest are with my daughter and my son. \", \\'When was the first time you were present at a ceremony?\\', \"Pleskov: Oh! That was so long ago, I don\\'t remember. \", \\'Is the Oscar night also about business?\\', \"Pleskov: What do you want to talk about? Everyone who is there and has a film that is nominated wants to win. That\\'s all about it. \", \\'In the 1970s, you and United Artists were regular guests when it came to the Best Pictures. \\', \\'Pleskov: Yes, that started in 1976 with Milos Forman and \"Einer flieg über das Kuckucksnest\". It happened only three times in the history of Oscars that a film won all five main prizes, i. e. : Best movie, director, script, leading actor and leading actress. The first was \"It Happened One Night\" by Frank Capra 1932; \"Kuckucksnest\" was the second, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" the third. \\', \"Did you also care about Milos Forman\\'s European origins?\", \\'Pleskov: I was more interested in the films he made in Czechoslovakia, for example, \"The Fireball\". As far as I am concerned, Forman was not particularly accessible personally. I never wanted to do this. Everyone did their job, film was the main thing. \\', \\'In 1978 \"Annie Hall\" was awarded Best Film. Now Woody Allen makes a series for Amazon. Do you think that\\\\\\'s interesting?\\', \\'Plesskov: The Allen is a workhorse, every year a film. The audience sometimes goes with more, sometimes less, but he always does very interesting things. Now he shoots his first series for a change. \\', \"What\\'s the big deal for a success with the Oscars? Is it enough to have a great movie, or do you have to invest a lot in advertising?\", \"Plesskov: Advertising doesn\\'t do that much. Of course you do promotion, but if the film is nothing, the best advertising campaign doesn\\'t do anything. At least it doesn\\'t affect how I vote. \", \\'Although the Olympic thought applies - be there, say: to be nominated is everything -, but of course in the media there is always \"the losers of the evening\". How do you deal with it?\\', \\'Plesskov: You live on. \\', \\'What was your worst night at the Oscars? Was that 1981 when \"Raging Bull\" that Scorsese made for you, the shorter drew towards \"Ordinary People\"?\\', \\'Pleskov: That wasn\\\\\\'t great, right. It\\\\\\'s better to win. (Laughs. ) I got really mad at \"Mississippi Burning\", a film about the murder of three civil rights activists, which was very important to me. Martin Luther King\\\\\\'s widow said that the blacks would not be shown heroically enough in it, letto Julian Bond, a well-known black politician from Atlanta - only they had not seen the film yet! I knew that cost us the Oscar and I didn\\\\\\'t go there anymore. \\', \"The Academy is always making absurd mistakes, isn\\'t it?\", \"Plesskov: There are no people who are without mistakes. And I don\\'t believe in something like swarm intelligence either. Look at the news about how things are happening in the world. We never learn anything from the past and make the same mistakes over and over again. \", \\'\"And the Oscar goes to. . . \" This year\\\\\\'s favorites with the most nominations\\', \\'Birdman (9 Nominations) Michael Keaton as an actor in career depth is afraid of aging, stress about his stage debut and a feathered alter ego on his neck\\', \\'The Grand Budapest Hotel (9) Vintage equipment cinema by Wes Anderson full of stars and slapstick. Concierge Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) was not even nominated\\', \"The Imitation Game (8) Math-against-Nazis film, which benefits mainly from the game of its star Benedict Cumberbatch - but at the British Oscars it didn\\'t use anything\", \"American Sniper (6) This true Iraq-warrior story is Clint Eastwood\\'s most commercially successful directing work ever. Oscars would be the wrong signal\", \"Boyhood (6 Nominations) Richard Linklater\\'s real-time study of a youth in Texas deserves every Oscar - and as the best supporting actress nobody more than Patricia Arquette\"]'],\n",

       "array(['[\\'Wolfgang Murnberger sits at a window table at Café Eiles and makes a very relaxed impression. A TV team says goodbye, I follow. Will this be a long interview day today? No, not bad at all, says the filmmaker, he doesn\\\\\\'t have so many. And then, with a slightly mischievous grin: \"Most of it has to be done by Josef. \"\\', \\'Since the last film with Josef Hader as private detective Simon Brenner, \"Der Bonemann\" has been the most successful domestic production of 2009 with over 280,000 visitors in Austria alone. Since then, director Murnberger has shot at least ten television films, along with the first completely renewed domestic \"Tatort\", three episodes of the TV series \"Paul Kemp\", certainly twice as many of \"Four Women and a Death\" and for the cinema the (anti-)Nazi film \"Mein beste Fein\" with Moritz Bleibtreu, Georg Friedrich and Marthe Keller. \\', \\'And next week begins \"Eternal Life\". It is the filmmaker\\\\\\'s fourth collaboration with the actor Josef Hader and the author Wolf Haas. Moreover, it is certainly the most personal, \"arthouse-igst\" Brenner film so far, says Murnberger. \\', \\'It\\\\\\'s all the more strange that \"The Eternal Life\", unlike \"Silentium\" or \"The Bone Man\", was not shown at the Berlinale Film Festival - but that really doesn\\\\\\'t speak against the film. \\', \\'Falter: You intend to reach even more viewers than with the last film. How important is your audience success?\\', \\'Wolfgang Murnberger: You always wish for him. I grew up in a cinema in the country and experienced the death of the cinema close up. We locked it up in 1985, and I already had the feeling that the cinema also fails a bit from the films. Grad in the 70s sometimes the more interesting things went on television. \\', \\'You mean Austrian films?\\', \"Murnberger: Yes, I didn\\'t know much else at the time. And it\\'s like that: movies work without an audience, not a cinema. \", \"Aren\\'t Netflix or Youtube the better movie theater anyway?\", \\'Murnberger: What they can\\\\\\'t do is to sit together there. Today concerts are going much better again, because the experience in the group has already added charm. Recently in the movie casino I saw \"Birdman\", it was good for me. \\', \\'Does cinema make demands other than television?\\', \\'Murnberger: Definitely. I see many movies in the cinema, where I think: actually a TV movie. This has a lot to do with show values, with the form of storytelling. In my first films \"Heaven or Hell\" and \"I vow\" it was quite clear that they never work on television at 8. 15 pm. This requires a different dramaturgy, the plot must be intertwined and told in such a way that you always want to know how it goes on - otherwise people switch away. \\', \\'The Brenner films are the rare case of a series that gets better and better from time to time. This may have to do with Haas-Hader-Murnberger, who are working on every screenplay for three and a very long time, simply spare the hero nothing, but get him even harder to the delight of the audience in every film. \\', \\'Thus the title \"Eternal Life\" already promises nothing good: no salvation, namely, but, on the contrary, that everything goes on forever. For example, the burner will have to work forever until 84, before it is entitled to a pension. Jessas na!\\', \\'There is no much more exposure than this sobering information about social security: Josef Hader is known, Hader is known as Simon Brenner. This direct complicity between star/figure and audience is a good part of the success of a series. \\', \\'Murnberger: Of course you already know the Brenner for ten years now. He comes back to Graz at the beginning of the film from Vienna, and thus you are already in the middle of the story. I am reminded of the principle of the old Django movies: Django you have known - only the woman was once blond, sometimes black, and the final duel was once with a Mexican, once with Lee Van Cleef. Most important was the main character, who comes back and with whom you look at the next adventure. That has something, and you have that with the Brenner meanwhile. \\', \\'But everything around Simon Brenner is different this time. Berti, who celebrated his coming-out as a romantic hero in the \"Knochenmann\", is not there for the first time. And also the Schurke was not occupied with a German for the first time; Bernd Michael Lade, Joachim Król and Josef Bierbichler now follows a Tyrolean with Tobias Moretti. His young wife plays Nora von Waldstätten, which Murnberger first saw as a terrorist in the French film \"Carlos\". \\', \"As far as the craftsmanship of book and film is concerned, supporting characters are often meaningful: are they living characters, or are they merely staffage and only there to check off the next plot point? What great things Roland Düringer shows in the broad-legged role of the old-fashioned merchant Köck and especially Johannes Silberschneider as Brenner\\'s somewhat annoying neighbour in the family house settlement in Graz-Putigam. \", \"Murnberger: If you read the novel, then what Düringer brings with you fits very well with the Köck. I don\\'t think actors can play anything. Only actors believe that, and in the theater, maybe, women play male roles, but the more realistic a film is, the more difficult it becomes. Even if you film some worker and your hands only come into the picture once - that can\\'t be done. \", \\'The most difficult part has Nora from forest sites, how did you come up with it?\\', \\'Murnberger: We have been looking for a woman who is believed to commit a cold-blooded murder out of love. She needs coolness and a certain hardness. Nora has both. For me, she is a bit like Catherine Deneuve in \"Belle de jour\" by Buñuel, so beautiful and yet so unapproachable. \\', \\'Wolfgang Murnberger is a filmmaker in every case. One who, as he himself says, \"always tries the balancing act between arthouse and commercial film. \" In the way he works, he feels like Andreas Prochaska, the specialist for genre cinema of all kinds. \"We never want to reinvent cinema, but tell people,\" says Murnberger. \"We want to tell stories. \"\\', \\'He has also been a professor of directing at the Vienna Film Academy for two years. A good counterpart to Michael Haneke, who strongly encouraged him to teach. Murnberger knows the house from his own experience. Among his fellow students were the later directors Michael Glawogger and Michael Sturminger; with both he forged plans for films, which were never realized. What do you teach the students?\\', \\'Murnberger: I see my main task in accompanying them in their projects so far that they ask themselves the right questions: What do I want to tell you? And why?\\', \"Michael Haneke said the only thing that doesn\\'t lack film academy is self-confidence. \", \"Murnberger: That\\'s right. You don\\'t know what that\\'s all about, but I did. I played bass and rhythm guitar and also believed that I would become as famous with the band as the Beatles. \", \\'Has that ever been documented?\\', \\'Murnberger: No, I got off at 19. It was the same at the film academy: I had the feeling that I saw so many movies by Tarkowski and Buñuel, I now know how to do it. This self-confidence! I was never the self-confident guy, but totally shy. \\', \"Didn\\'t you want to be a painter?\", \"Murnberger: That\\'s how I saw myself, yes. I alone with the screen. But they didn\\'t take me at Schillerplatz. After the musician\\'s career had failed, the German studies had failed and the painter\\'s career had also failed, I knew: OK, I can\\'t fail at the film academy now. \", \\'Who were your most important reference persons there?\\', \\'Murnberger: The first years I only had the Alfons Stummer, the director of the \"Förster im Silberwald\". What we had to say soon exhausted. Christian Jordan, who had worked as a director\\\\\\'s assistant with Fritz Lehner and then unfortunately died. I studied editing, screenplay and directing, and actually you learn the most - at the editing table you see clearly what everything is not possible. \\', \\'Speaking of, something that doesn\\\\\\'t work at all and that\\\\\\'s why the press screenings of \"Eternal Life\" caused salmon salves, is the scene in which Brenner rushes to resaw a tree that hit a giant hole in the roof of his house. Majestic, like in slow motion, he flips over, exactly on the car of his strenuous neighbor. \\', \\'For the director, this is one of the key scenes of the film, which shows \"how easy a life like this can be patched: Although you only meant it well, it\\\\\\'s gonna suck. \"\\', \\'This is especially true for the scene in which Simon Brenner almost shoots himself with a loud headache. \"The whole thing is a bit sophisticated,\" admits Wolfgang Murnberger, \"because in the end the burner also has a hole in the head. And of course I then tried to get the hole in the roof and the hole in the head into the picture together. \" F\\', \\'From 6. 3 in the cinemas\\', \\'About the film\\', \\'Yesterday he stood on the edge of the abyss, today he is one step further. \"Eternal Life\", the fourth film to Wolf Haas, takes the life-counted Brenner back to the home town of Graz and into a stupid story from the time at the police school. One of his two Haberers is murdered at that time; the other, meanwhile head of the criminal police, directs the investigation and is married to a doctor who could be his daughter - or that of the Brenner. \"Eternal Life\" is a modern film noir, the hardest entry of the series so far. \\', \\'The person\\', \\'Wolfgang Murnberger. With his final film at the Vienna Film Academy, \"Himmel oder Hölle\" (1990), Murnberger landed a veritable cinema success. Today, the 54-year-old, who grew up in Wiesen, is one of the country\\\\\\'s most busy film and television directors. Next, he prepares a biopic about Erich Kästner for German television. Murnberger is the father of four children and lives in Wiener Neustadt\\']'],\n",

       "array(['[\\'It is not only the best book on punk, but one of the best books ever, says Greil Marcus about \"Clothes, Clothes, Clothes, Music, Music, Boys, Boys, Boys\" by Viv Albertine. The compliment comes from a knowledgeable mouth: Marcus is one of the great punk experts, with \"Lipstick Traces\" the US author has written a key work on the subject. \\', \\'The British band The Slits has a special position there: one of their songs has the power to rewrite the history of rock music, writes Marcus. Viv Albertine was a guitarist and songwriter of the Slits, who took the world out of the way at the end of the 1970s without the world really having noticed it. \\', \\'They became icons only after their dissolution: As the first purely female cast and, at the same time, also genre conventions lustfully ignoring punk band, the Slits are still a role model of feminist pop rebellion, their song \"Typical Girls\" is the associated hymn. It can be found on the album \"Cut\" from 1979, which is no longer missing in any list of the most important records of all time. \\', \"Greil Marcus is right: Viv Albertine\\'s biography, so far only available in English, is a masterpiece. Exciting and lively, but always calm, modest and reflective with all emotionality, she tells the story of a British working-class girl who is looking for a different life, whatever it is. \", \\'\"When I grow up, I\\\\\\'ll become a pop singer,\" Viv, as a young Beatles fan, opens to her father. \"You\\\\\\'re not chic enough for that,\" he destroys her dreams. Later, Viv Albertine was supposed to define her own chic, and because there were no examples breaking with the male conventions, she also invented a very own way of playing guitar. Not masculine and dedicating antivirtuos. \\', \\'Punk made it possible, gave space to her differentness. Viv Albertine was in the centre of London from the very beginning, but her memories never turn into a heroic epic. Free from transfiguration, she tells entertaining and lively stories in which characters such as Sex Pistols manager Malcom McLaren, designer Vivienne Westwood or Mick Jones, the guitarist of The Clash, are not stars, but friends, acquaintances, lovers. \\', \\'McLaren is not a cynical genius, but the friendly guy who shakes her hand at an early sex-pistols concert and is happy that there are already eleven people in the audience - and at his bizarre funeral Albertine feels far more than at the passing of her own father. \\', \\'Or Mick Jones, the great icon: he\\\\\\'s just the cute student colleague at the art school who helps Albertine select the first guitar and suffers from her on-off relationship for a long time, but is still a loyal friend to this day. And of course Sid Vicious: Pop history has assigned the bassist of Sex Pistols the place of the broken \"No Future\" poster boy - a junkie monster who killed his girlfriend in heroin rush and soon died of an overdose himself. For Viv Albertine he was a friend. A shy guy who overplayed his insecurity through cynicism, a difficult person with a good core. She tells of spit-out lessons, shameful tenderness, Sid\\\\\\'s girl\\\\\\'s handwriting - and of how caring and emotional he could be. \\', \"You don\\'t need punk knowledge to get carried away by this book: it\\'s also easy to read as a feminist developmental novel, which by no means breaks down with the end of the Slits in 1981. The supposed glamour of the rock world and the daily struggle as an unconventional young woman in the music business is replaced by the struggle that means life. \", \\'Albertine puts the guitar in the corner and becomes an aerobics trainer, then she studies film, works as a director, becomes a ceramic artist, marries and tries to become pregnant for years. When it finally works out, she gets a cancer diagnosis shortly after birth. It is not the last time that her life plays badly. \\', \\'Viv Albertine tells all of this in brutal openness up to the quality of her labia. Her marriage fails, whereby the actor Vincent Gallo plays a special role (no, no sex); the artist in Albertine awakens to new life. She mocks the housewife, unpacks the guitar again, records new songs and plays the leading role in Joanna Hogg\\\\\\'s film \"Exhibition\". \\', \\'Now Viv Albertine comes to Vienna. She will present her book, have a public conversation with journalist Isabella Reicher and show the film. Unfortunately, she does not have her guitar with her. \\', \\'An evening with Viv Albertine: Filmcasino, Thu 1. 10. , 7. 30 p. m. \\']'],\n",

Instead of rushing through the Augarten near her apartment as usual, the nine-year-old has landed in Vindobona at Wallensteinplatz, and now she is supposed to stay still. However, what proves to be unproblematic: Lotti is a cozy dog, Clara Luzia adopted the hybrid from the shelter two years ago. \\', \\'After long periods of illness - half physical, half mental - the 37-year-old Viennese folk pop musician is finally good things these days: relaxed, solved and positively tuned. Last year the singer married her partner and quit her bread job at the APA in order to concentrate exclusively on the music. The first results are the beautiful new album \"Here\\\\\\'s to Nemesis\" and an engagement at the Stadttheater Klagenfurt, where Clara Luzia currently contributes the music to a piece about the poet Christine Lavant. \\', \\'Falter: Apart from the initials: What connects you to Christine Lavant?\\', \\'Clara Luzia: With all the differences but similar worlds of experience. When I was asked for the piece, I knew her name, but not her work. At the first reading I thought to myself: Jössas na! My first antipathy quickly turned back into great sympathy. \\', \\'Where did the original antipathy come from?\\', \\'Luzia: I thought to myself when I read: \"I know exactly what you\\\\\\'re talking about, I know these emotional places, but I don\\\\\\'t want to go back there anymore!\"\\', \"Lavant\\'s birthday was the 100th anniversary this year, so she lived in a completely different time and place. What is it you know?\", \\'Luzia: This tiredness of life, paired with an extreme urge to survive. This stubbornness: I actually want to die, but I certainly don\\\\\\'t kill myself. Or \"probably not\", as it eventually relativized. For me, killing was an option for a while, but as you can see, I didn\\\\\\'t do it. What connects us is the world\\\\\\'s pain. Or more soberly formulated: the depression. In many poems of her I thought to myself: That\\\\\\'s my song! She uses other images, but she describes exactly the same thing. \\', \\'Is not such a theater engagement distracting from the actual artistic work?\\', \"Luzia: I feel it\\'s a pleasant holiday from the me. I don\\'t just want to work like this, because I want to say something, but after all the years of me-on-tabletting it was pleasant to set up only existing texts. \", \"Aren\\'t you afraid to reveal too much of yourself in your own songs?\", \\'Luzia: My songwriting does not follow any analytical considerations. It comes as it comes, and I hardly ever change the lyrics afterwards. I wish I could, because sometimes I am actually too open and direct. But that will have its reason. \\', \\'\"It takes wounds and scars till weak is strong\" you sing on the new record. Is that your translation of Grandpa\\\\\\'s old wisdom \"What doesn\\\\\\'t kill us just makes us harder\"?\\', \"Luzia: At the core it probably means the same thing. The way to knowledge or to age mildness also includes many watches. But they don\\'t necessarily make you harder - the spectrum ranges from harder to hardy to generous. In the course of life you can\\'t spare wounds. If you didn\\'t, you missed something or did something wrong. \", \\'You found age wisdom at the age of 30?\\', \\'Luzia: No, of course not. But there was a change of perspective, the motto is now: Get out of the hole! I have hard years behind me, but for the time being I feel at least outgrown. \\', \\'You have been the pop singer for a long time, who has an office job at APA during the day. In 2014 you quit. \\', \"Luzia: It was an impulse decision, and a few weeks later I thought to myself: Shit, what did I do there? But that\\'s what I\\'m used to. I miss the job because it was a lot of fun. I don\\'t miss the many bad news. For twelve years three times a week, for eight hours, just typing negatives about the state of the world, that does something with one. \", \\'In the title of the new album \"Here\\\\\\'s to Nemesis\" do you therefore call Nemesis, the Greek goddess of revenge?\\', \\'Luzia: I see her as a goddess of just anger, not a goddess of revenge. I am concerned with the idea of balancing justice. Probably my Catholic heritage comes to bear: the idea of the Last Judgment. This power symbolizes Nemesis. Lyrics do not offer the place for scientific treatises, because one needs images that transport as much as possible. I am concerned with something like cosmic balance, to use a great term: If refugees drown in front of Lampedusa or if someone in Germany is beaten to death on the street for his civilian courage, these are not things that do not affect us. In reality, all of us hurt - if we still have any sense. \\', \\'Speaking of, is Strache going to be mayor?\\', \\'Luzia: I hope not, because that would be a disaster. \\', \\'Why?\\', \\'Luzia: Because he could already do a lot. Above all, the change in the climate scares me. If right-wing parties have the majority, some hurdles quickly fall. Then there are with one time no \"That can\\\\\\'t be said\" anymore. On Facebook this is already like this: When the first refugee streams came to Vienna, everything was full of stupid hate postings. In front of this very mood of \"If one says something, the other also dares\" I am afraid. Luckily, this has completely changed - and suddenly even the Kronen Zeitung was collecting donations. It\\\\\\'s nice that not only the stupid ones shout the loudest. \\', \\'The hate preachers stand in the face of this\\', \"Wouldn\\'t humanity be pathetic? Luzia: I hope so, but I can\\'t judge it, because fortunately I myself live in a man-of-kind swamp - and I consciously use this discredited term very positively. A man-of-kind is simply a good person, and a good person is for me one who sees not only himself, but the big picture, and who is aware that there is a responsibility for everyone. The term is actually badly chosen by the right: wanting to do something bad from the good shows just how crude their reasoning logic is. \", \\'How does it live economically as an Austrian indiepop celebrity?\\', \\'Luzia: Prekär! But this is generally true for cultural workers at this level. Without the support of my wife and only from the income from the music it would hardly be possible. This is not a permanent state, so I will have to think about something: either a world hit - or I am still looking for a reasonable job. \\', \\'There is no lack of affection, but it does not smear the butter on the bread. \\', \"Luzia: I made a crowdfunding campaign for the production of the new album for the first time, and that\\'s where this affection has helped a lot. It was kind of an emergency: the first bills were rolled in, but there was no money there. So I started this action in a night-and-nebula action. A few hours later I was crying with luck in front of the computer, because very quickly a lot came in, both money and acceptance. \", \\'Is there a Viennese pop miracle, as it is often called?\\', \\'Luzia: It may be perceived as a miracle. I think that we are experiencing the natural development of a growth. A dwarf sat there for some time on the shoulders of the previous one. Wanda did come out of nowhere a little bit and their success is indeed remarkable, but the rest has simply grown naturally. If one grows a seed and becomes a flower from it, one does not say: \"Oh my God, what a miracle!\"\\', \\'As a central protagonist, how do you assess the development of the pop city of Vienna?\\', \"Luzia: I found the zero years extremely exciting, while now a bit of waste is coming in again, but that\\'s probably because of me rather than the pop city of Vienna. The fact is that at that time many labels founded themselves and there was the impulse to make it quite simply after a long thirsty distance. It was clear to us that there would be no airplay anyway, so we simply worked on it without even having an ear on the charts for a second. There was a lot of development. Also a lot of weirdes, but all the more exciting. And that\\'s a bit over. Ö3 opens up, the major labels have the foot in the door - and this in turn works back on the music that is made. That\\'s not bad per se, but for me personally not so interesting. \", \"So you\\'re not a fan of Wanda and picture book?\", \\'Luzia: I don\\\\\\'t mean that at all. Wanda is even the opposite of squeaking on radio airplay, I never thought that this could work with this sound. I find picture book fantastic, I have always loved it. Wanda runs with me rather under \"guilty pleasure\". I sometimes like to hear it, but I get annoyed by this gockelding. \\', \\'Most recently, Wanda was swirled because the controversial German author Ronja von Rönne plays in a video. \\', \\'Luzia: I didn\\\\\\'t read her text. Because I have a very thin skin, I don\\\\\\'t look at many things anymore, which I know would upset me terribly. And with the headline \"Why Feminism Disgusts Me\", I just knew: I\\\\\\'d rather not look, Clara!\\', \\'In short, she says feminism is about sitting in the waiting room and whining at the locked door, while she prefers to open the door and walk through it. \\', \\'Luzia: Maybe I should read it anyway. Only when I hear that there is talk of \"feminism\" it will be difficult again - there is no feminism. Of course, this sacrificial feminism exists, with which I can only start something very conditionally, but there are so many different forms, it really can\\\\\\'t be joked about a comb. \\', \\'The dynamic is of course interesting, how quickly a confident young woman is condemned because of a polemic formulation as an \"anti-feminist\". \\', \\'Luzia: On the net, you can judge extremely quickly. You have to be terribly careful about what you say, because you are immediately torn apart from all sides. At some point, you think about what you say three times. For freedom of expression, this is not particularly helpful, although the basic idea of the Internet, in which every voice is heard wonderfully democratically, would of course be very good. As so often we humans turn something good into something bad. Everyone dares to scold himself in the worst possible way, a critical argument takes place only in marginalized rooms. Even without dealing with it, I have of course repeatedly come across comments on the Rönne case. Either it was broken or praised. The truth lies in between here as well. \\', \\'On the new album you cover Lana Del Rey. How come?\\', \\'Luzia: By a misunderstanding. I was invited to play a song of the past year at a year\\\\\\'s review party. I thought it was supposed to be a song from the charts, and I loved \"West Coast\". Everyone else outdone on Obskurem, so I was the only one with a mainstream song. But then it was so good for me that it ended up on the record. That\\\\\\'s all I had to do with Lana Del Rey. \\', \"How you keep it with Miley Cyrus, I\\'d rather not ask. \", \"Luzia: I love Miley Cyrus! She doesn\\'t have to be so nutty all the time, but otherwise I think she\\'s great. She has a great voice, she sings fantastically, her new record is great and clever, and she\\'s smart as well. I don\\'t need the permanent oversexualization. \", \"Isn\\'t Miley\\'s kind of self-determined nutty pretty cool anyway?\", \\'Luzia: She presents it as a self-confident decision, and it would be presumptuous to say that I know it better and that Miley does not really want it, but only meets expectations. However, in a position in which you are an idol for incredibly many girls and young women, you should already think about the effects of his actions. And whatever Miley thinks about it usually does arrive: \"Get out, then you get the public!\"\\', \\'This summer, you posed in the VOR magazine yourself with bare upper body to promote your Popfest appearance. \\', \\'Luzia: The photographer asked me how to describe my new album. \"Naked and bony\", I said, he jokingly suggested a nude photo. I didn\\\\\\'t have to have that at Karlsplatz, but on top of it with my hands in front of my chest I found it okay. I was just succumbed to the charm of doing something that no one would expect of me. Strangely enough, there was no reaction to it. \\', \\'I was already scared on the tram. \\', \"Luzia: But you\\'re the only one, not even my mom said anything. Apparently, all women are expected to get undressed sooner or later. \", \\'What is the drug of your choice?\\', \"Luzia: Gin and beer, still. I want to start smoking again for months, but I just don\\'t succeed. I\\'ve been on quite a lot of pills for years, but these were nebulizing medications. Rather not so nice so. Since they\\'re dropped off, I really yearn for drugs, but there\\'s no one in my life. Not even coke I\\'ve ever taken. \", \\'\"The Drug\\\\\\'s Don\\\\\\'t Work\" once sang the Britpop band The Verve. They now sing: \"The Drugs Do Work\". You have no idea!\\', \"Luzia: This song is also not about drugs in the sense, but about being lulled into society as if we were on drugs all the time. We are so clouded by artificially created consumption needs and the information overflow that we can\\'t really get excited about the really important things. These drugs work very well. \", \"Who\\'s using these drugs?\", \\'Luzia: We administer them to ourselves. There is no great evil from the outside. \\', \\'To the plate\\', \\'With her fifth album \"We Are Fish\" Clara Luzia said goodbye to the folk-pop-schwermut in 2013 and exclaimed the new passion for rocking. That was a good idea, but it seemed to force a tick. It\\\\\\'s different now with \"Here\\\\\\'s to Nemesis\" (Asinella, from 9. 10. ): Recorded with trio cast, it\\\\\\'s not only Clara Luzia\\\\\\'s pop record, it\\\\\\'s also her concentrated and despite the new self-limiting multifaceted album so far. There may also be a groovebox, the guitar sounds like Sixties surf music and the rhythm section gently feathers up to casually groovy. Marking melodies are not too scarce, and a certain fight-joy is associated with the melancholy. \\', \\'The person\\', \\'Clara Luzia, 37, is actually called Clara Luzia Maria Humpel-Priemer. The singer/songwriter grew up in the Lower Austrian province, the Viennese music scene has played a decisive role since the turn of the millennium - initially with the band Alalie Lilt, since 2005 as Clara Luzia. She runs the record label Asinella, delivered the title song for Andreas Prochaska\\\\\\'s film \"Das sindige Tal\" in 2014 and currently provides the music for the piece \"Lavant!\" at the Stadttheater Klagenfurt\\', \\'Live:\\', \\'Wuk, 28. 10. , 8 p. m. \\', \\'PPC Graz 29. 10. , 7. 30 p. m. \\']'],\n",

The idea of an early morning celebration as an extension of the club night is of course nothing new, but the \"Morning Gloryville\" parties do not see themselves as an after-hour, but as a cheermaker before a working day. The music is the same as in the normal clubs; radiationd faces are seen on the dance floor as well. \"We don\\\\\\'t need alcohol and not necessarily drugs\", says a young woman with glitter in her face in the video that Spiegel Online shot on a Berlin Wednesday morning at one of the Gloryville parties.
